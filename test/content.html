If men and women were living together without marrying, each gender was equally likely to initiate a breakup</p></h2> <p>In a presentation to the American Sociological Association, researchers report that women are more likely than men to ask for divorce. But non-marital breakups are more gender neutral.</p> <p>The results came from an analysis of the aptly named &#x201C;How Couples Meet and Stay Together&#x201D; survey, collected from 2,262 adults with opposite sex partners who answered questions about their relationship status between 2009 and 2015. Women initiated 69% of divorces, compared to 31% of men. But if men and women were living together without marrying, each gender was equally likely to initiate a breakup.</p> <p>Almost all studies to date have shown that women are more likely to ask for divorce, the study&#x2019;s lead author, Michael Rosenfeld, said in a statement. An associate professor of sociology at Stanford University, Rosenfeld said that social scientists assumed that women&#x2019;s heightened sensitivities to the ups and downs of relationships would mean they were more likely to leave both marriages and non-marital unions.</p> <p>But the latest data suggests that perhaps there&#x2019;s more involved. Women may be responding to the still arcane conventions of spousal roles, which contrast with growing equality in other institutions, such as the workplace. &#x201C;I think that marriage as an institution has been a little bit slow to catch up with expectations for gender equality. Wives still take their husbands&#x2019; surnames, and are sometimes pressured to do so. Husbands still expect their wives to do the bulk of the housework and the bulk of the childcare,&#x201D; he said in the statement. &#x201C;On the other hand, I think that non-marital relationships lack the historical baggage and expectations of marriage, which makes the non-marital relationships more flexible and therefore more adaptable to modern expectations &#x2026; of gender equality.&#x201D;</p>  </section>
