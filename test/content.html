      --> <p>Teens who form close, loving relationships with a grandparent are more likely to have fewer behavioral and emotional problems than less-attached teens, says a study published online in the American Journal of Orthopsychiatry.</p> <p>The benefits to the teens were even greater when they were also close to the parent who was the offspring of the grandparent, the study found.</p> <p>Grandparents are often seen as performing a useful role when parents and teens aren&#x2019;t getting along. This study suggests grandparents also can complement good relationships between parents and teens.</p> <p>The study, at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, surveyed 1,405 teens, age 12 to 18 years old, enrolled in a larger study. Teens reported adjustment difficulties on questionnaires that measured hyperactivity, emotional symptoms such as excessive worrying, social skills, and fighting and bullying. They also rated their relationships to grandparents and parents.</p> <p>The average teen adjustment score was 11.5 out of a possible 40 &#x2013; a higher score indicating greater difficulties. About 65% of the grandparents identified as closest to teens were maternal grandmothers, and 60% were age 70 or older. </p> <p>Teens who had close relationships with parents and grandparents had the fewest problems. But closeness to grandparents didn&#x2019;t matter if teens weren&#x2019;t close to parents. </p> <p>For teens with average emotional closeness to their parents, contact with their closest grandparent was linked with significantly reduced adjustment difficulties, though the reduction was moderate. For teens who had very close parental relationships, the closest grandparent played an even stronger role in reducing adjustment difficulties. </p> <p>Despite adolescents&#x2019; increasing independence, parents and grandparents continue to play an important role in their development, said the study&#x2019;s author Dr. Shalhevet Attar-Schwartz, a senior lecturer at the university. </p> <p>Caveat: Adjustment difficulties were self-reported by teens. The study was conducted in one country.</p> <p> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26237053" target="_blank" class="icon none">Emotional Closeness to Parents and Grandparents: A Moderated Mediation Model Predicting Adolescent Adjustment</a> </p> <p>*</p> <p> <strong>Baby fat:</strong> Gestational diabetes is difficult to predict during pregnancy. Research at the University of Massachusetts Medical School found what may be a way to assess who is at risk even before a woman becomes pregnant.</p> <p>The research, published online in the journal Diabetologia, showed that women with gestational diabetes tend to have abnormally large fat cells, called adipocytes, with a limited capacity to expand and support the growing fetus. Adipocytes, which naturally expand as pregnancy progresses, are less functional when they reach maximum size, the researchers said. The adipocytes can secrete factors that contribute to inflammation and insulin resistance, which are associated with gestational diabetes, the researchers added.</p> <p> <!--
        --> Dr. Silvia Corvera,<!--
      --> who holds the Endowed Chair in Diabetes Research at the medical school, said the features that characterize fat cell abnormalities are likely present in women at risk for gestational diabetes before they become pregnant and may be useful in assessing their risk. The researchers are designing a study to determine how soon adipocyte abnormalities can be detected in pregnancy.</p> <p> <a href="https://www.nichd.nih.gov/publications/pubs/gest_diabetes/Pages/sub1.aspx" target="_blank" class="icon none">Gestational diabetes </a>develops in 5% of pregnancies and can affect the health of infants and mothers, according to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.</p> <p>From 2013 to 2014, researchers at the medical school recruited 18 pregnant women having caesarean deliveries, including five with gestational diabetes, 11 without the condition, and two with Type 2 diabetes. Three nonpregnant women undergoing a type of weight-loss surgery were also recruited.</p> <p>Samples of omental adipocytes, which form a layer of fatty tissue inside the abdomen, and subcutaneous adipocytes, just below the skin, were taken during the surgeries. Omental adipocytes from women with gestational diabetes were significantly larger than those without gestational diabetes but similar in size to women with Type 2 diabetes. The size of omental fat cells increased as glucose levels increased, the study showed. Small adipocyte size is associated with better glucose and insulin levels, according to the study.</p> <p>The study also identified significant genetic differences between fatty tissue from pregnant and nonpregnant women, and between pregnant women with and without gestational diabetes.</p> <p>Caveat: The study was small, and women with gestational diabetes tended to be older and with a higher body-mass index than those without the condition.</p> <p> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26067361" target="_blank" class="icon none">Human adipose tissue expansion in pregnancy is impaired in gestational diabetes mellitus</a> </p> <p>*</p> <p> <strong>Oxygen therapy:</strong> Breathing pure oxygen at high air pressure for short periods every day&#x2014;a common treatment for scuba-diving injuries&#x2014; significantly reduced painful body areas in women with fibromyalgia over two months compared with a control group, according to a small study in PLOS One.</p> <p>The treatment, called hyperbaric oxygen therapy, also triggered changes in brain regions known to have abnormal activity in fibromyalgia, the study found. Most participants stopped or reduced pain medications after the study.</p> <p>Increasing oxygen concentrations may alter inflammatory pathways and change the brain circuitry associated with pain, the study suggests.</p> <p> <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/fibromyalgia.html" target="_blank" class="icon none">Fibromyalgia</a> is a poorly understood pain syndrome that affects 2% to 4% of the population, mostly women, the researchers said. Symptoms include widespread pain, tender body areas, fatigue and impaired cognition and memory.</p> <p>From 2010 to 2012, researchers in Israel recruited 48 women age 21 to 67 years old who had had fibromyalgia for an average of 6.5 years. Half of the subjects received 90 minutes of hyperbaric oxygen therapy in a pressurized chamber five days a week, a total of 40 sessions. The rest, a control group, received the treatment after the two-month study. <a href="https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002375.htm" target="_blank" class="icon none">Hyperbaric oxygen therapy</a> involves exposure to 100% oxygen at twice the normal atmospheric pressure. </p> <p>Before the study, the average number of tender body areas in both groups was 17. Among the participants receiving the treatment, the number of tender areas was reduced by an average of 8.5. Controls had no change during the study period, but after also receiving treatment they had 11.5 fewer tender areas, on average. Pain thresholds also improved significantly in both groups after the treatment.</p> <p>Oxygen therapy elevated activity in the front of the brain and reduced activity in the back or posterior brain. Earlier studies showed reduced frontal, and elevated posterior, brain activity in fibromyalgia patients, the researchers said.</p> <p>Caveat: Five patients withdrew from the study because of dizziness, claustrophobia and uncomfortable ear pressure. The long-term effects of hyperbaric oxygen therapy aren&#x2019;t known.</p> <p> <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127012" target="_blank" class="icon none">Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Can Diminish Fibromyalgia Syndrome &#x2013; Prospective Clinical Trial</a> </p> <p>*</p> <p> <strong>Caviar tongue:</strong> Researchers have discovered a possible new method of screening for high blood pressure: looking under the tongue.</p> <p>Dental patients with an abundance of tangled and dilated blood vessels on the underside of the tongue, a benign condition known as sublingual varices or &#x201C;caviar tongue,&#x201D; were twice as likely to have high blood pressure than those with few, if any, visible blood vessels, according to a study in BMC Oral Health.</p> <p>Prominent blood vessels in the mouth are often found during dental checkups, especially in smokers and people with cardiovascular disease, but it wasn&#x2019;t known if the vessels were associated with hypertension, researchers said. Sublingual varices may be due to weakening of the vessel wall related to aging, they said.</p> <p>From 2010 to 2013, researchers recruited 431 patients, age 55 years old on average, from a dental clinic in Varberg, Sweden. Blood pressure was measured in the dental clinic and, in some cases, with additional home readings. Tongue varicosities were determined from digital photos and graded either 0 (none to a few) or 1 (medium to severe).</p> <p>About 28% of the patients had hypertension. Sublingual varices were present in 27% of participants, including 48% of those with hypertension and 18% with normal blood pressure. The prevalence of medium-to-severe varicosities increased from 22% in participants with normal blood pressure to 44% in those with very high pressure.</p> <p>Sublingual varices were present in 65% of smokers with hypertension and 45% of smokers with normal blood pressure.</p> <p>Caveat: Digital photographs were used to estimate the number of sublingual varices.</p> <p> <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4499223/" target="_blank" class="icon none">Is there a connection between sublingual varices and hypertension?</a> </p> <p>*</p> <p> <strong>Golfer gains:</strong> Recreational golfers had significantly lower handicaps, longer driving distances and reduced joint pain following shoulder-replacement surgery compared with before surgery, according to a small study in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicine. About a third of golfers reported improvements in their golf swing after surgery.</p> <p>The shoulders play an important role in the amount of energy transmitted to the ball and the swing path of the club during a golf swing, researchers said. Degenerative arthritis of the glenohumeral or shoulder joint can affect the range of motion and rotation of the arm, which are key to creating a proper swing, they said.</p> <p>An estimated <a href="http://www.statisticbrain.com/golf-player-demographic-statistics" target="_blank" class="icon none">29 million people in the U.S. play golf</a>, according to the National Golfing Foundation. Few studies have examined the effects of total shoulder arthroplasty, or shoulder-replacement surgery, on player performance, the researchers said.</p> <p>The study, at the Albany Medical Center in New York state, identified 35 golfers from a survey of 268 patients, who underwent shoulder-replacement surgery between 2004 and 2013. Participants, ranging in age from 57 to 80 years old, had played the sport for an average of 24 years. The right shoulder was replaced in 20 patients, the left in 14, and one person had both shoulders done. Patients were followed for about three years.</p> <p>Thirty-one subjects resumed golfing an average of 8.4 months after getting a new shoulder and four were unable to return to the game. On average, driving distances increased by 12.5 yards and golfing handicaps by 1.4 strokes. Of the returning golfers, 96% reported a significant improvement in shoulder pain during and after playing, and 83% stopped taking pain medications.</p> <p>About 53,000 <a href="http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00094" target="_blank" class="icon none">shoulder replacements</a> are performed in the U.S. every year, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. </p> <p>Caveat: Golfers self-reported driving distances and handicaps.</p> <p> <a href="http://journals.lww.com/cjsportsmed/Abstract/2015/07000/Impact_of_Total_Shoulder_Arthroplasty_on_Golfing.5.aspx" target="_blank" class="icon none">Impact of Total Shoulder Arthroplasty on Golfing Activity</a> </p> <!--
