<h2 class="rich_media_title" id="activity-name"> Demand for cultural calendars rising </h2><div class="rich_media_content " id="js_content"> <p>The central government&apos;s clampdown on lavish spending by public officials has helped spawn a renaissance in one area of publishing&#xFF0D;the production of high-quality calendars that highlight the country&apos;s culture.</p><p><br></p><p>Such calendars, with exquisite art and writing, have become hugely popular since October 2013. That&apos;s when the spending crackdown put a halt to the decades-old annual ritual of State-owned companies buying and giving calendars as gifts&#xFF0D;although not of the quality of the artistic ones now on the market.</p><p><br></p><p>As a result, publishers have competed to come up with calendars for which people are willing to fork out good money.</p><p><br></p><p>One such customer is Xu Caixia, 29, of Suzhou, Jiangsu province. A few days ago, she was delighted to receive by courier a calendar whose theme is the Chinese novel A Dream of Red Mansions. It was the second calendar she bought for 2016.</p><p><br></p><p>&quot;Earlier I got a Forbidden City calendar,&quot; said Xu, an aficionado of painting and calligraphy. &quot;I wasn&apos;t expecting much from the second one, and it has really surprised me. It was beautifully packaged, and there is a timeline of the life of the author, Cao Xueqin.&quot;</p><p><z><br></z></p><p><z><img data-s="300,640" data-type="jpeg" data-src="http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz/zewUhjznGmgvdE39S9yr6AWXXtL9Q2lHpF0J7JICxnib7H72fvvVTBwGNb7bncsxB1amF9KNS6tXRH7mU76EMMg/0?wx_fmt=jpeg" data-ratio="0.6996402877697842" data-w="" src="http://mmbiz.qpic.cn/mmbiz/zewUhjznGmgvdE39S9yr6AWXXtL9Q2lHpF0J7JICxnib7H72fvvVTBwGNb7bncsxB1amF9KNS6tXRH7mU76EMMg/0?wx_fmt=jpeg" use="data-src"><br></z></p><p><br></p><p><z></z><span>Inside the calendar are more than 100 poems from the novel and their interpretation, as well as more than 100 samples of ancient Chinese painting and calligraphy.</span></p><p><span><br></span></p><p><span>In Beijing, Polley Wu, 29, bought a calendar whose theme is food.
