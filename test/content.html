Batteries are bulky, expensive, and risk polluting the environment with harmful chemicals when improperly disposed of. This DIY water-powered flashlight, however, uses an energy source that&#x2019;s safe and free.</p> <p>Instructables user <a href="http://www.instructables.com/member/ASCAS/" target="_blank">ASCAS</a> published his step-by-step instructions <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Water-Powered-Flashlight/?ALLSTEPS" target="_blank">online</a> for creating an H2O-fueled flashlight out of PVC pipe and a special battery. The most important step is constructing the <a href="http://chemistry.about.com/od/chemicalstructures/g/Galvanic-Cell-Definition.htm" target="_blank">galvanic cell</a> for the flashlight&apos;s core. This type of battery works through a salt bridge connecting two different metals (in this case, zinc and copper). It&#x2019;s the same basic principle behind how a store-bought battery works, but in this case water is the electrolyte that powers it. It produces a pretty weak voltage, so the flashlight calls for the construction of a <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Making-A-Simple-Joule-Thief-made-easy/" target="_blank">&#x201C;Joule Thief Circuit&#x201D;</a> that&#x2019;s capable of stretching the life out of faint batteries to power an LED. Some other materials include a general purpose NPN transistor, 1K Ohm resistor, copper wire, and tissue paper (things you should have no trouble finding at a hardware store, electronics store, or at home). The final product runs for 30 continuous minutes with tap water and up to 2 hours with saltwater. According to ASCAS, the ideal fuel is vinegar and Gatorade which are both rich in electrolytes.</p> <p>While it does require water to function, it would be more accurate to say the flashlight is powered by its galvanic cell. The purpose of using water as the battery&#x2019;s electrolyte is that it removes the need for heavy metals like lead and mercury that are often seen in conventional batteries. It also means you don&#x2019;t have to pack batteries on your next camping trip as long as there&#x2019;s a stream or other water source nearby.
