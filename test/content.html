Broadcast K-pop across the border through giant loudspeakers, apparently.</p> <p>This tactic has been proven by South Korea, who just gained the apology it wanted from the North for their recent landmine attacks, which maimed two of its soldiers. The apology comes after the South Korean army has reportedly been blasting K-pop music across the DMZ for two weeks as part of its anti-Pyongyang propaganda tactic. </p> <p>All the best K-Pop tunes were used to drown out the authoritarian North&apos;s propaganda at eleven locations along the border&apos;s front lines, with Big Bang&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ips2mM7Zqw">Bang Bang Bang</a>&quot; being played on repeat. It seems that G-Dragon&apos;s talents not only make an impact in the world of music and fashion, but politics too.<br> <br> It is believed the other two K-pop songs being played were <a href="http://www.dazeddigital.com/tag/girls-generation">Girls&apos; Generation</a>&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6SwiSpudKWI">Genie</a>,&quot; and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IU_(singer)">IU</a>&apos;s &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dm3Gf9Dd0vo">Heart</a>&quot;.</p> <p>The North apparently tried to retaliate with speakers of their own, but the sound quality was too poor to be understood. The Department of Defence revealed the nickname of the broadcasts to be &quot;The Sound of Hope,&quot; uncannily similar to the North&apos;s FM broadcast &quot;The Sound of Freedom&quot;.</p> <p>In addition to the K-pop ammunition, South Korea relayed broadcasts criticising the North&apos;s poor financial status.</p> <p>It&apos;s not the first time South Korea has applied this powerful tactic. In 2010, they blasted K-pop girl group <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/4Minute">4minute</a>&apos;s song &quot;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRbIZtUS2Ag">HuH (Hit Your Heart)</a>&quot; across the border through the airwaves.</p> <p>In exchange for the apology, South Korea has now agreed to turn down the music, much to many fans&apos; disappointment.</p></div>
