<p class=""> &#x201C;I think a museum is a bad place to look at art.&#x201D; </p><div class=""> <p><span>Banksy&#x2019;s satirical Dismaland Bemusement Park is something that has managed to capture the attention of art and pop-culture enthusiasts alike, with the main draw resting in ones own interpretation of what it all means. In a rare interview with <em>The Guardian</em>, the artist talks about his curatorial project and gives a unique insight into the world of contemporary art.</span></p> <blockquote><p> <strong>What is this thing?</strong></p> <p>In essence it&#x2019;s a festival of art, amusements and entry-level anarchism. A place where you can get your counterculture easily available over the counter. A theme park for the disenfranchised, with franchises available. I guess you&#x2019;d say its a theme park whose big theme is &#x2013; theme parks should have bigger themes.</p> <p><strong>Why is this thing? </strong></p> <p>If you&#x2019;re the kind of person who feels jaded by the over-corporate blandness that passes for family light entertainment, then this is the bespoke leisure opportunity that will connect with your core brand dynamic. It doesn&#x2019;t so much ask the question, &#x201C;What is the point in art now?&#x201D; as ask, &#x201C;What is the point in asking, &#x2018;What is the point in art now?&#x2019;&#x201D;</p> <p><strong>You&#x2019;ve described low-income families as &#x201C;the perfect art audience&#x201D;. Why?</strong></p> <p>&#x201C;Low-income holidaymakers&#x201D; are the perfect art audience. There&#x2019;s something very evocative about the British seaside experience. This show is modelled on the failed winter wonderlands they build every December that get shut down by trading standards &#x2013; where they charge &#xA3;20 to look at some alsatians with antlers taped to their heads towing a sleigh made from a skip. Essentially this is a theme park that Lawrence Llewelyn Bowen would endorse. The advantage of putting art in a small seaside town is you&#x2019;re only competing with donkeys.I think a museum is a bad place to look at art; the worst context for art is other art. </p></blockquote> <p>You can find the full interview <a title="here" href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/aug/21/banksy-dismaland-art-amusements-and-anarchism?CMP=twt_gu" target="_blank">here</a>.</p> <p>Dismaland is open from 11am-11pm until September 27.</p> </div>
