First, you take one super-aggro rap duo (Run the Jewels) whose members (Killer Mike and El-P) are both sarcastic wiseasses in addition to being skilled artists. Second, the duo jokingly <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1957344648/meow-the-jewels" target="_blank">crowdfunds an all-cat-sounds remix</a> of their stellar second album, <em>Run the Jewels 2</em>. Third, people <em>go for it</em>. Fourth, all kinds of great people get involved, and the album actually gets made. (On <a href="http://www.daylightcurfew.com/products/meow-the-jewels-2xlp" target="_blank">double vinyl</a>, no less.)</p> <p>What&#x2019;s fifth? Fifth is the fact that it&#x2019;s time for a video from <em>Meow the Jewels</em>. &#x201C;Meowpurrdy&#x201D; is the <em>MTJ</em> version of <em>RTJ2</em>&#x2018;s opening track, and the visuals are nothing short of a cosmic battle of (cat) good versus (cat) evil. Well, either that or someone slipped DMT into our drink.</p> <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link focusable bg-white" href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/platinum-games-tmnt/#start-of-content">Go Back to Top.

Andrew House, the current president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. in Tokyo, will head the newly-formed company, with former PlayStation boss (and current CEO of all of Sony) Kazuo Hirai on the board.</p> <p>&#x201C;By integrating the strengths of PlayStation&#x2019;s hardware, software, content and network operations, SIE will become an even stronger entity, with a clear objective to further accelerate the growth of the PlayStation business,&#x201D; said House in a statement.</p> <p>Founded in 1993 to launch the original PlayStation, Sony Computer Entertainment has long been headquartered in Tokyo. The move to San Mateo (where the PlayStation business recently moved in to an opulent office complex) certainly reflects the shifting priorities and business of the PlayStation consoles.</p> <p>Established in 2010, Sony Network Entertainment International was the home of all of Sony&#x2019;s online content businesses, including PlayStation Network but also the PlayStation Vue television service and PlayStation Music among others.</p> <p>Based on a simple organization chart included with <a href="http://www.scei.co.jp/corporate/release/160126a_e.html" target="_blank">today&#x2019;s release</a>, it seems like the CEO positions of the American and European branches of Sony Computer Entertainment have been eliminated in favor of having Andrew House as the unit&#x2019;s single president and CEO. Shawn Layden, currently president and CEO of Sony Computer Entertainment America, seems positioned to lead Sony&#x2019;s worldwide game development studios as of April.</p> <p>PlayStation 4 has been a major bright spot in Sony&#x2019;s portfolio; the company said earlier this month that the console has sold over 35 million units worldwide since its launch in 2013.</p> <a class="visually-hidden skip-to-text-link focusable bg-white" href="http://www.wired.com/2016/01/platinum-games-tmnt/#start-of-content">Go Back to Top.
