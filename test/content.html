Beginning today, Prime Now is also spreading to Amazon Prime subscribers in Bellevue, Redmond, and Kirkland. More importantly, Seattle marks the first location in the United States where Amazon will bring you wine, beer, and liquor on demand.</p> <p>You&apos;ll need to enter your zip code at the company&apos;s website to confirm that Amazon&apos;s instant gratification service is really available at your address. Prime Now has previously rolled out in Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Chicago, Dallas, Indianapolis, Manhattan, and Miami.</p> <div class="m-ad m-ad__article-body">  </div> <p>&quot;Tens of thousands&quot; of products can be purchased through the service, though for many items you&apos;ll still need to wait for free two-day shipping (or Prime&apos;s cheap overnight delivery) like some kind of animal. In the Seattle vicinity, Amazon says Prime Now deliveries will run from 8AM local time until midnight &#x2014; yes, Sundays included. As in other cities, you&apos;ll have to pay extra ($7.99) to receive a package within the hour, but if you can wait even just two hours, it&apos;s completely free. As the name implies, you&apos;ll need an active Amazon Prime subscription ($99/year) to take advantage of the service.</p> <ul class="m-article__sources"> <li class="source"><strong>Source</strong><a href="http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=176060&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=2081798">Amazon</a></li> <li class="tags"><strong>Related Items</strong> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/amazon">amazon</a> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/instant-gratification">instant gratification</a> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/prime">prime</a> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/amazon-prime">amazon prime</a> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/one--hour-delivery">one-hour delivery</a> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/prime-now">prime now</a> <a href="http://www.theverge.com/tag/instant-delivery">instant delivery</a> </li> </ul> </div> </div>
