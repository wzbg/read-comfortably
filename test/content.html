<p>At first glance, Francis Bacon’s 1945 <em>Figure in a Landscape</em> seems a dismal character – a grey and imposing body crouched forward on an isolated bench.</p>
<p>But don the proffered pair of headphones and a remarkable transformation takes place. Illuminated by lights, the form is transported into a new context as bustling sounds of the city bounce forth, the clanging of construction evoking the impression of furious activity, the laughter of children indicating a vibrant park.</p>
<p>A deep, smoky scent rises from chocolates placed in front of the painting. The scene becomes intensified as a bitter, burnt rush engulfs the mouth, the gritty texture of the chocolate reinforcing the harshness of the city, with orange adding sweetness and warmth. Suddenly the figure stands out as a weary yet sinister soul in a lively, frenetic world.</p>
<p>The experience is part of Tate Sensorium, which opens on Wednesday at <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/tatebritain" data-link-name="auto-linked-tag" data-component="auto-linked-tag" class=" u-underline">Tate Britain</a> – a small but mighty exhibition that draws together experts in sound, taste, scent and touch as well as lighting and theatre. “What we are doing is testing out, with the public, a new way of experiencing art, a new way of presenting art,” says Tony Guillan, multimedia producer for Tate Media.</p>
<p>The brainchild of London-based creative studio Flying Object, the intimate experience (only four people are admitted at a time) is the winner of this year’s <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/about/projects/ik-prize" title="" data-link-name="in body link" data-component="in-body-link" class=" u-underline">IK Prize</a>, scooping £10,000 in prize money and a further £60,000 to create the installation. Now in its second year, the award is presented by the Tate for an innovative use of digital technology to engage the public with the gallery’s vast collection of British art.</p>
<p>“We wanted to really get into the museum space and do something which actually played with the way that you’re experiencing the art,” says Tom Pursey, co-founder of Flying Object.</p>
<p>It’s not the only attempt to augment artwork – the National Gallery is currently pairing audio interpretations with paintings in its Soundscapes exhibition. But Flying Object hope to stimulate noses, hands and tongues as well. It’s a notion that master chocolatier Paul A Young has enthusiastically embraced in devising chocolates to accompany<em> Figure in a Landscape</em>. “I wanted it to feel like you were touching it,” he says.</p>
<p>All four sections of the exhibition incorporate a sound element, created by audio specialist Nick Ryan. But while <em>Figure in a Landscape</em> boasts an almost narrative composition, others are more abstract. Clanging bells and tremendous roars burst forth while viewing John Latham’s <em>Full Stop</em>, followed by the heavy pitter-patter of a downpour. It’s an interpretation mirrored by a haptic device that uses focused ultrasound to stimulate visitors’ hands hovering in the air above it, leaving the bizarre impression of rain falling upwards on to the fingertips.</p>
<p>“It’s really like if you have a straw and you blow through it – it’s this focused air pressure you are feeling on your hand,” says Dr Marianna Obrist, an expert in interactive technologies from the University of Sussex.</p>
<p>The sensual combination, explains Ryan, highlights both the dominant nature of the image and its detail. “It dawns on you over time that the edge is porous,” he says of the painting.</p>

<p>Indeed, Ryan has employed a host of technological innovations, from binaural recordings to reproduce 3D soundscapes to directional audio – which essentially means sounds can only be heard by visitors when they are standing at specific locations relative to the speakers.</p>
<p>When close to David Bomberg’s geometrical painting <em>In the Hold</em>, visitors hear clangs and shouts representing the sounds of a ship; step back to another spot and the sounds are fragmented by notes from the “Bomtree” – an instrument created by Ryan from perspex segments laser-cut to match sections of the painting. “I wanted to literally hear what the painting would sound like,” he says.</p>
<p>Scents by expert “Odette Toilette” aim to draw visitors further into the painting – a stimulus also deployed in the interpretation of Richard Hamilton’s <em>Interior II</em>, where odours such as hairspray are fused with domestic noises. Additional wafts of glue and sounds of paper being cut nod to Hamilton’s use of collage.</p>
<p>While admitting the sensory elements reflect their own interpretations, Pursey and his team are quick to reject the idea that they undermine personal interpretation. “When you’re given a smell, it can suddenly take you to a part of your life which is very vivid in the mind,” says Pursey. “So actually I would flip it the other way and say the multisensory element of this allows us to get into a much more personal rendition of it.”</p>
<p>Visitors will also be provided with wristbands that record their electrodermal activity. “It is using, basically, sweating to infer something about how intense the experience might have [been] perceived,” says Obrist. Combined with questionnaires, she hopes to use the data to explore patterns in the way visitors respond to Tate Sensorium – and will spend three days conducting additional experiments and interviews with visitors.</p>
<p>But not everyone is convinced. “Normally those physiological signals require multiple measures to eliminate the noise from the signal,” says Oxford University’s Professor Charles Spence.</p>
<p>“While it’s a nice idea in theory, my worry has been that I haven’t seen successful use of these kinds of wearable technologies yet.”</p>
<p>Pursey, however, is optimistic. At the end of their trip, visitors will be provided with their data and a personalised map of Tate Britain showing other works that might resonate with the senses.Indeed, he is hopeful that Tate Sensorium will offer visitors a new way to explore art. “I think it will be interesting to give people almost a toolkit for how they can go up to another artwork and start thinking about it from a sensory point of view,” he says.</p>
<p><em>Tate Sensorium runs from Wednesday until 20 September</em></p>
