And in the old days, those territories weren&#x2019;t nearly as diverse as they are today,&#x201D; association president and chief executive John Fithian said in a speech at the CinemaCon conference in Las Vegas on Tuesday.</p> <p>&#x201C;Now, the overseas theatrical markets with the fastest growth rates are found in Asia and Latin America.&#x201D;</p> <p>The Chinese-made 3D fantasy/adventure film <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/sep/14/monster-hunt-biggest-film-of-all-time-in-china">Monster Hunt broke a string of box-office records </a>on its release in the country in July 2015, becoming the highest grossing film ever. It has since been surpassed by <a href="http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mei_ren_yu/">The Mermaid</a>, another locally made fantasy/adventure film targeted at the country&#x2019;s huge new urban cinema audience, which has taken $500m since its release in February.</p> <p>Fithian attributed the worldwide numbers in part to improved theatres, replete with better seats and sound, bigger screens and expanded offerings of refreshments.</p> <p>He also highlighted the movie-going appetite of adolescents.</p> <p>&#x201C;That demographic represents only 8% of the US population, but a stellar 16% share of movie tickets purchased,&#x201D; Fithian said.</p> <p>&#x201C;The small screens of television may hold less appeal for teenagers. But the big screens of cinema, and the personal screens of hand-held devices, can co-exist quite well,&#x201D; he added.</p> <p>Another factor, he said, was diversity, touching on a recent Hollywood race row. </p> <p>&#x201C;The more that movie casting looks like the world, the more the world goes to the movies,&#x201D; he said, pointing to Furious 7 as an example.</p> <p>As for the current year, Fithian said box office receipts were up 12.7% in the first quarter.</p> <p>&#x201C;Cinema admissions have continued to soar lately with a trio of summer-type blockbusters early in the year &#x2013; Deadpool, Zootopia and Batman v Superman,&#x201D; he said.</p> <p><br></p></div>
