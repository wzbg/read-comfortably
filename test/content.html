The applications for design, creativity and productivity <em>should</em> be obvious.</p><div class="incontentAd cnGptAlign_HorizontalCentered cnGptNotFullWidthSlot cnGptSlotOuter" id="article-top_GptOuter"><div class="cnGptSlotInner" id="article-top"></div></div><p>What is odd is that this relatively simple package has proven to be so comprehensively mystifying to reviewers. Is it a laptop? Is it a giant tablet? Where has it been &apos;positioned&apos; relative to Apple&apos;s laptops and Microsoft&apos;s superficially similar (but in reality very different) Surface Pro 3, or the iPad Air? All of these questions appear to have consumed the attention of those given early access to the iPad Pro, to the extent that some have even bemoaned its lack of Windows 10 complexity, or the fact that it doesn&apos;t support <em>mouse</em> input.<em><br></em></p><p>It&apos;s to the iPad Pro&apos;s credit, then, that as soon as you start using it -- not looking at it, or prodding its keyboard, but using it to make things -- that all of those questions melt away. What&apos;s left is something which, like the original iPad, is much greater than the sum of its parts.

Yes, it is large at 12.9 inches diagonally -- at first glance it verges on amusingly big, for anyone already familiar with an iPad. Quickly, however, you get used to its physical size and start to appreciate the very fine nature of its construction. Physically it is very thin -- just 6.9 mm -- and weighs about the same as the original iPad at around 713 grams. That&apos;s quite hefty if you were planning to hold it in one hand as a book, but light otherwise.</p><p>Externally, it&apos;s largely unsurprising in appearance, with the same general feel and shape as Apple&apos;s other iOS products. But hidden beneath that trademark finish are some brilliant touches. There are four speakers in the iPad Pro, for instance, which are located on each corner of the machine and automatically adjust based on how you&apos;re holding it. The volume output is three times that of the iPad Air, and together they produce a rich, balanced sound with plenty of bass.</p><p>The processor, an &apos;A9X&apos; with a 64-bit architecture, delivers twice the CPU and graphics performance of the iPad Air 2, and is extremely powerful, to the point where WIRED experienced no slowdown at any point even when drawing in 3D, playing the most demanding games in our library and multitasking with two apps side-by-side. You can edit multiple 4K videos at once, run 3D games at 60 FPS and switch between all of the above instantly. It&apos;s noticeable, even without turning to benchmarks, just how well-tuned this machine is. It&apos;s remarkable, in fact.</p><p>But the most obvious feature of the iPad Pro, and arguably its best, is the display. Screen technology has so rapidly advanced across mobile devices that it is easy to become jaded, but the iPad Pro feels like a genuine stride forward even in the context of 4K smartphones and the 5K iMac. With 5.6 million pixels (2732 by 2048 pixels) the iPad Pro has the highest resolution screen on any iOS device. It&apos;s supremely clear, bright and sharp. It&apos;s also noticeably resistant to fingerprints, and reflections.</p><p>More important than the pixel count, however, is the combination of hardware and clever software that changes how the display actually works. This is down to the display&apos;s new oxide thin film transistor, which is similar to that used in the 5K iMac, and a new (to iOS) process by which liquid crystal molecules are aligned with UV rays. It also possible because of the introduction of variable refresh rate, which chances how often the screen updates based on how you use it, producing a more efficient and uniform use of light. All of this tech is tuned to perfection, in the manner that only Apple seems able to achieve. Together they mean that the iPad Pro has the most impressive screen on vritually any mobile device, including smartphones.</p><p>With 10 hours battery life and the option of up to 128GB (having just 32GB on the base model is stingy, obviously), as well as a faintly ludicrous (but apparently popular) camera, M9 motion co-processor and TouchID sensor, all the basics are in place for the iPad Pro to be at the very least an extremely solid and satisfying tablet.</p><div class="incontentAd cnGptAlign_HorizontalCentered cnGptNotFullWidthSlot cnGptSlotOuter" id="incontentAd_additional0_GptOuter"><div class="cnGptSlotInner" id="incontentAd_additional0"></div></div> <figure class="imageBlob portrait pullToSide" data-asset-id="621348"> <div class="stickyInner"> <a class="embiggener" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/reviews/tablets/2015-11/ipad-pro-review/viewgallery/621348"> <img alt="" class=" ssrMultiImg" data-aspectratio="0.67" data-maxheight="1920" data-maxwidth="1280" data-srcsizedata="{&quot;values&quot;:[{&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;height&quot;:1920,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1280x1920/a_c/comic12.jpg&quot;}]}" src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1280x1920/a_c/comic12.jpg" orig-src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1280x1920/a_c/comic12.jpg" use="src"> </a> <figcaption class="image-caption"><span class="image-credits">WIRED/Michael Rundle</span> </figcaption> </div> </figure> <figure class="imageBlob landscape keepInline" data-asset-id="621344"> <div class="stickyInner"> <a class="embiggener" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/reviews/tablets/2015-11/ipad-pro-review/viewgallery/621344"> <img alt="" class=" ssrMultiImg" data-aspectratio="1.5" data-maxheight="1280" data-maxwidth="1920" data-srcsizedata="{&quot;values&quot;:[{&quot;width&quot;:620,&quot;height&quot;:413,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/o_r/Photo-16-11-2015,-20-59-34.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:1240,&quot;height&quot;:826,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1240x826/o_r/Photo-16-11-2015,-20-59-34.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:1920,&quot;height&quot;:1280,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1920x1280/o_r/Photo-16-11-2015,-20-59-34.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:458,&quot;height&quot;:305,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/458x305/o_r/Photo-16-11-2015,-20-59-34.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:281,&quot;height&quot;:187,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/281x187/o_r/Photo-16-11-2015,-20-59-34.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:195,&quot;height&quot;:130,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/195x130/o_r/Photo-16-11-2015,-20-59-34.jpg&quot;}]}" src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/o_r/Photo-16-11-2015,-20-59-34.jpg" orig-src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/o_r/Photo-16-11-2015,-20-59-34.jpg" use="src"> </a> <figcaption class="image-caption"><span class="image-credits">WIRED/Michael Rundle</span> </figcaption> </div> </figure> <h3 class="heading">The Pencil</h3><p>Styluses are difficult to get right, but when they work, they are a transformative creative tool. The evidence? Well, for a start, you could take more or less every great work of visual art produced before 1980. And many of the best since then, too.</p><p>So whether or not you think Steve Jobs&apos;s 2007 proclamation about their pointlessness on a 3.5-inch device was correct or not (for the record, I think he was absolutely on the money), on a big-enough screen, or graphics tablet, or piece of paper, or canvas, it is still true that <em>sticks</em> (for that is what they are) have value. For anyone who works with images or design, or simply prefers the dexterity of a natural tool in the human hand to the touch of a finger or judder of a mouse, sticks <em>rule</em>.</p><p>Despite this, the sheer complexity of the technology involved in making a sharp-pointed pen accurately interact with a digital screen -- at least in a way that is even close to that of a real implement on paper -- and the mistaken perception among most people that they &apos;can&apos;t draw&apos;, has left styluses on the relative fringe of the computing world. Wacom has made excellent drawing devices for many years, including its extremely good but expensive, and heavy, Cintiq drawing displays, but until very recently accurate pen input was not present on many consumer devices. Microsoft&apos;s Surface tablets have changed that, most notably with its breakthrough Surface Pro 3, and the Samsung Galaxy Note line of smartphones has also done great things on a smaller screen. But the technology itself -- or rather the concept -- has not gained crossover appeal.</p><p>Apple&apos;s Pencil will be the greatest weapon yet in that fight. Though expensive, at an additional &#xA3;79, the Pencil is a premium piece of technology. Crafted to have the weight and simplicity of a universal drawing device, rather than the techy precision (down to its shirt pocket clip) of the Surface Pro pen, it&apos;s lovely to hold, smooth and weighted and not as &apos;plasticy&apos; as you might assume from photos. Its tip is just resistant enough to have the feel of a pencil on paper when gliding across the screen, and it is perfectly proportioned for both sweeping lines and detail work. And it <em>is</em> extremely precise. On most drawing apps -- in fact all but one of those which WIRED tested -- lines appear <em>directly</em> below the tip of the pencil, in a very convincing manner. It&apos;s not quite perfect, but it&apos;s close. The inclusion of pressure and tilt sensitivity makes it more versatile than you might expect (though an eraser would have been nice). And unlike the Surface, when you press down hard on the screen, the display does not &apos;give&apos; or show any distortion: the iPad Pro can take your artistic aggression and throw it back at you. With quick charging via the Lightning port (you can give it a half-hour boost in just 15 seconds) it&apos;s always ready to use.</p><p>What the Pencil <em>isn&apos;t</em> is a primary input device: the iPad Pro is not designed to be used mainly by the Pencil, they are designed to complement each other. You can interact with the iPad only with the Pencil if you want too, but it doesn&apos;t make much sense. Some reviews have said this is a reflection of poor OS design or conceptual thinking -- but WIRED disagrees. The iPad is a touchscreen device, spacious (perhaps absurdly so on the home screen) and simple. The Pencil is a precision tool to use when drawing, writing and designing things. The Surface Pro pretends both of these things should be done together, all at once -- that you will want to &apos;write&apos; on web pages and use a pen for a full Photoshop experience. Apple knows that you probably don&apos;t.</p><h3 class="heading">Smart Keyboard</h3><p>The iPad Pro does not come with a hardware keyboard, you&apos;ll have to buy one separately. All of these will connect through the new three-point magnetic connector on the iPad&apos;s side, or Bluetooth, and if you need one you&apos;ll find one to suit your needs. Apple&apos;s Smart Keyboard, which unfolds through a relatively complex feat of origami to rest below the iPad in landscape mode is just one choice, and in our test proved to be a very decent option, with fabric-to-the-touch but clicky keys, responsive input and just enough space to make quick typing of long documents possible. It lacks the adaptability of the Surface Pro 3 and its kickstand (or all laptops) offering only one angle from which to type. It also feels a little cramped. Right now it&apos;s only available in US English and it&apos;s expensive at &#xA3;139. Others from the likes of Brydge and Belkin will surely follow, and might suit you better.</p><div class="incontentAd cnGptAlign_HorizontalCentered cnGptNotFullWidthSlot cnGptSlotOuter" id="incontentAd_additional1_GptOuter"><div class="cnGptSlotInner" id="incontentAd_additional1"></div></div> <figure class="imageBlob portrait pullToSide" data-asset-id="621353"> <div class="stickyInner"> <a class="embiggener" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/reviews/tablets/2015-11/ipad-pro-review/viewgallery/621353"> <img alt="" class=" ssrMultiImg" data-aspectratio="0.67" data-maxheight="1920" data-maxwidth="1280" data-srcsizedata="{&quot;values&quot;:[{&quot;width&quot;:309,&quot;height&quot;:465,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/309x465/a_c/comic22.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:462,&quot;height&quot;:693,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/462x693/a_c/comic22.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:1280,&quot;height&quot;:1920,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1280x1920/a_c/comic22.jpg&quot;}]}" src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/309x465/a_c/comic22.jpg" orig-src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/309x465/a_c/comic22.jpg" use="src"> </a> <figcaption class="image-caption"><span class="image-credits">WIRED/Michael Rundle</span> </figcaption> </div> </figure> <p>As with the Pencil, however, the iPad Pro is not designed to be used principally through the keyboard. There is no touchpad or (sigh) mouse, and you&apos;ll need to interact mainly through touch and then unfold your keyboard when you actually want to type something. Most of the time that&apos;s perfectly fine. For some uses -- say when putting together a post with images, video and formatting for WIRED.co.uk -- it&apos;s a bit irritating. But it&apos;s a compromise. As Apple has said before, no one wants a touchscreen laptop, and it&apos;s a fact of life for the iPad Pro that this kind of complex multitasking -- despite its neat ability to run apps as large as the iPad Air 2 side-by-side, with zero lag -- is just easier on a straightforward laptop. They are different types of machines, and they work differently.</p> <figure class="imageBlob landscape keepInline" data-asset-id="621339"> <div class="stickyInner"> <a class="embiggener" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/reviews/tablets/2015-11/ipad-pro-review/viewgallery/621339"> <img alt="" class=" ssrMultiImg" data-aspectratio="1.5" data-maxheight="1280" data-maxwidth="1920" data-srcsizedata="{&quot;values&quot;:[{&quot;width&quot;:620,&quot;height&quot;:413,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-48-07.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:1240,&quot;height&quot;:826,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1240x826/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-48-07.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:1920,&quot;height&quot;:1280,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1920x1280/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-48-07.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:458,&quot;height&quot;:305,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/458x305/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-48-07.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:281,&quot;height&quot;:187,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/281x187/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-48-07.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:195,&quot;height&quot;:130,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/195x130/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-48-07.jpg&quot;}]}" src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-48-07.jpg" orig-src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-48-07.jpg" use="src"> </a> <figcaption class="image-caption"><span class="image-credits">WIRED/Michael Rundle</span> </figcaption> </div> </figure> <h3 class="heading">Software</h3><p>So far the iPad Pro might sound like a well-made, conceptually slightly curious and pricey tablet. For many people that might be exactly accurate. But what transforms it, and turns it into something much, much more valuable, is the same thing that has allowed Apple&apos;s iOS ecosystem to outstrip much &apos;bigger&apos; competitors for almost a decade: apps.</p><p>To be clear, Paper by 53 is perhaps the most delightful note-taking app ever made. The intuitive and counter-reality manner in which it simulates ink leaving a pen (thicker lines when you draw faster, smooth but not overly softened flow) remains as impressive today as it did at launch. On the iPad Pro the added space and Pencil support gives it a new precision and power. Adobe Sketch, Procreate and Pixelmator are similarly enhanced, also boosted by the A9X&apos;s additional firepower. 3D design (Umake), music production (Auxy, Beatwave, Garageband), video production (iMovie) and even writing (Microsoft Word, IA Writer) are similarly transformed. There are fantastic piano playing apps, music tuition software, drum machines and educational encyclopaedias. There are collaborative painting apps, collage tools and anything else you can name. Virtually all of them, already, are better on the iPad Pro. And more will follow.</p><p>This is significant not just for the raw creative potential these apps possess, but for how they work in concert. Having such a rich landscape of creative tools just a double press of the home button away leads to a cross-pollination of ideas and processes that no other system can really match. The Surface Pro 3 might have OneNote and &apos;full&apos; Photoshop, but it does not have a single drawing app as delightful as Paper, an image editor as simple and powerful as Pixelmator or a subtly useable layer-based editor as Procreate. Use these apps together, to make one piece of work, and the possibilities are profound.</p><p>Put this on-iPad power alongside Astropad, which via the Lightning connector can work with a Mac laptop or desktop to turn the device into a virtually perfect mock-Cintiq, and the other riches of the iOS store in gaming, media and video, messaging and photos, and you have, more or less, a limitless world of creative potential. That&apos;s not because the developers have done Apple&apos;s work for them -- it&apos;s because Apple has provided a hardware foundation so strong, and in the case of the iPad Pro even visionary, that they have responded in kind.</p><h3 class="heading">So what<em> is</em> it?</h3><p>With their suite of creative tools (Garageband, iMovie) Macs have always sold themselves on the dream that they can transform &apos;normal&apos; people into artistic, philosopher kings. And as we know, most people end up using their laptops for Netflix and email.</p><p>That&apos;s fine in one sense -- not everyone wants to paint in their spare time. But the problem is also one of conceptual <em>accessibility</em>. Even if the majority of people did want to use Apple&apos;s desktop tools to the fullest, computers have never really made that as simple as we pretend. These tools are still too abstract, too technical, and too difficult to enjoy on a pure, subconscious level. As long as making things is still about <em>clicking</em> stuff, not tangibly interacting with it, or drawing it, our tools are biased to people who enjoy engineering more than they enjoy creating.</p><p>The iPad helped to change that, but lacked the precision required to follow it through. The iPad Pro makes that transition complete. It&apos;s not hyperbole to say that this is the first device to fully realise the vision of the Mac: to take the making of art, and give it a digital interface that can match a pen and paper. Its arrival launches a new rich age of new creative tools, which the VR painting app <a href="http://www.tiltbrush.com/">TiltBrush</a> and Sony&apos;s <a href="http://dreams.mediamolecule.com/">Dreams</a> might enrich even further in 2016.</p><div class="incontentAd cnGptAlign_HorizontalCentered cnGptNotFullWidthSlot cnGptSlotOuter" id="article-bottom_GptOuter"><div class="cnGptSlotInner" id="article-bottom"></div></div><p>Is it expensive? Arguably, yes. Close to &#xA3;1,000 for the highest spec model with a Pencil and keyboard is a lot. But it&apos;s not more than a decent laptop, and will last for years, and isn&apos;t that much more than an iPad Air or -- for that matter -- a good guitar, a piano or a few years of art supplies.</p><p>Because no, the iPad Pro is not a laptop. If you largely work with words, via a complex content management system, and enjoy your laptop already -- as is true for most journalists who have reviewed the thing, not coincidentally -- then it might not be for you.</p><p>The iPad Pro is <em>something else</em>. It&apos;s not just &apos;good for designers&apos;, it is a <em>breakthrough instrument for making things</em>. And if you use it for more than 10 seconds to scrawl a bad version of your website&apos;s logo, and you have an interest in what it makes <em>possible</em>, rather than what it can <em>replicate</em> in your current setup, you&apos;ll understand that.</p> <figure class="imageBlob landscape keepInline" data-asset-id="621338"> <div class="stickyInner"> <a class="embiggener" href="http://www.wired.co.uk/reviews/tablets/2015-11/ipad-pro-review/viewgallery/621338"> <img alt="" class=" ssrMultiImg" data-aspectratio="1.5" data-maxheight="1280" data-maxwidth="1920" data-srcsizedata="{&quot;values&quot;:[{&quot;width&quot;:620,&quot;height&quot;:413,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-47-39.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:1240,&quot;height&quot;:826,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1240x826/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-47-39.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:1920,&quot;height&quot;:1280,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/1920x1280/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-47-39.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:458,&quot;height&quot;:305,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/458x305/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-47-39.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:281,&quot;height&quot;:187,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/281x187/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-47-39.jpg&quot;},{&quot;width&quot;:195,&quot;height&quot;:130,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;http://cdni.wired.co.uk/195x130/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-47-39.jpg&quot;}]}" src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-47-39.jpg" orig-src="http://cdni.wired.co.uk/620x413/d_f/File-17-11-2015,-07-47-39.jpg" use="src"> </a> <figcaption class="image-caption"><span class="image-credits">WIRED/Michael Rundle</span> </figcaption> </div> </figure> <h3 class="heading">Conclusion</h3><p>Like a Fender Stratocaster, a Daler-Rowney A3 sketchbook, or the World Wide Web, the iPad Pro will reward effort, focus and inspiration. But it presents no barriers to skill, either, and encourages experimentation and the taking of risks. Technically it is close-to-perfect, with a screen and power to match any equivalent device. But in concert with its software it transcends all competition; together the iPad Pro, the Pencil and the apps built to work with it are a transparent, inviting window into artistic, expressive play.</p><p>It&apos;s not perfect: the Smart Keyboard could be better, and iOS could do a better job of exploiting the large screen. Multitasking could be richer, and simpler. There are other niggles.</p><p>But if, in trying to review the iPad Pro, the best you can say is that it doesn&apos;t manage your company&apos;s blogging software as well as a laptop, and isn&apos;t very good at running Twitter, well, I&apos;m sorry: that ultimately says more about you and your failure of imagination than it says about Apple.</p><p>For me? That realisation is also a little terrifying, as I discovered drawing my graphic companion for this review. The truth is, there are no barriers any more, and no excuses. With the iPad Pro and Pencil, you don&apos;t need to &apos;know&apos; anything to get started. You just use them, and see what&apos;s inside you. There is nothing stopping you. What you make is what you make, for the good of the world or just the good of your soul.</p> <div id="productSpecs" class="expandyRowHolder"> <div class="expandyRowHeader"> <h2>Specifications</h2> </div> <dl> <dt>Display</dt> <dd> 12.9-inch (diagonal), 2732x2048 resolution at 264 ppi</dd> <dt>Rear-Camera</dt> <dd> 8MP iSight camera</dd> <dt>Front-Camera</dt> <dd> 1.2MP FaceTime HD camera</dd> <dt>Processor</dt> <dd> A9X chip with 64-bit architecture; M9 motion coprocessor</dd> <dt>Connectivity</dt> <dd> WiFi + LTE available</dd> <dt>Security</dt> <dd> Touch ID</dd> <dt>Battery</dt> <dd> 10 Hour battery life</dd> <dt>Other</dt> <dd> Siri/Apple Pay</dd> </dl> </div>    </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="promotions">   </div>  <div>  <div class="cnGptAlign_HorizontalCentered cnGptNotFullWidthSlot cnGptSlotOuter" id="ArticlePromo_GptOuter"><div class="cnGptSlotInner" id="ArticlePromo"></div></div> </div> </div> </article> </div>
