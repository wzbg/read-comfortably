From sales to marketing to engineering to customer service to management and even CEOs and board members.</p><p name="21d6" id="21d6" class="graf--p graf-after--p">When I started interviewing, I&#x2019;d estimate my hit rate was right around 50%, which means only 1 in 2 candidates would be a good fit for the role. Over the years and as I continued to interview and hire, I started to see the &#x201C;real life&#x201D; impact of hiring A-players.</p><p name="743b" id="743b" class="graf--p graf-after--p">If you haven&#x2019;t heard the term &#x201C;A-players&#x201D; before, don&#x2019;t feel bad. Here&#x2019;s a quick rundown &#x2014; when it comes to people in the context of work, you can generally group them into 3 categories:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="65ae" id="65ae" class="graf--li graf-after--p">A-players: the top 5% of people. They work hard, go over and above, are well liked and respected and typically move &#x201C;up the ranks&#x201D; fast.</li><li name="01dc" id="01dc" class="graf--li graf-after--li">B-players: most people. They do the 9&#x2013;5 thing, do their job well and are generally the &#x201C;good not great&#x201D; people.</li><li name="12d9" id="12d9" class="graf--li graf-after--li">C-players: the bottom 10%. They do just enough to scrape through, don&#x2019;t volunteer to take on new projects, like (and cause) conflict and have little to no personal accountability or responsibility.</li></ul><p name="4132" id="4132" class="graf--p graf-after--li">In terms of hiring, your managers are A/B/C players too, which means:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="4901" id="4901" class="graf--li graf-after--p">A-players love to hire other A-players and build teams of super smart people that love to win. They genuinely want to be the &#x201C;dumbest&#x201D; person in the room and love learning from those around them</li><li name="d01b" id="d01b" class="graf--li graf-after--li">B-players hire C-players because they&#x2019;re worried about someone coming in and taking their job</li><li name="c816" id="c816" class="graf--li graf-after--li">C-players don&#x2019;t really hire (too hard/too lazy), but if they do, they&#x2019;ll pretty much take whoever comes along</li></ul><p name="30ff" id="30ff" class="graf--p graf-after--li">So obviously you want to hire A-players, right? Good. I sat down earlier today and thought about all of the A-players I&#x2019;ve been fortunate enough to hire over the years at my 5 previous companies &#x2014; most of which are still in those companies today.</p><p name="a1fc" id="a1fc" class="graf--p graf-after--p">I thought about the commonalities between them and what &#x201C;makes them tick&#x201D; and I also thought about my actual interviews with them &#x2014; even the interviews back in the early 2000s. When I asked myself <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">&#x201C;What do they all have in common that would form the foundation of an A-player?&#x201D;</em>, I came up with a series of personality traits and past experiences.</p><p name="500d" id="500d" class="graf--p graf-after--p">I then looked at it from another angle and came up with 7 questions you can use in your interview process to give you a much better chance of finding and hiring them.</p><p name="3501" id="3501" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Here are those 7 questions:</p><p name="c580" id="c580" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q1: Have they been promoted at least once in a previous role?</strong></p><p name="32fb" id="32fb" class="graf--p graf-after--p">A-players are great at what they do and good managers will pick up on that fast, offering them more responsibility and eventually a more challenging role. Look at their LinkedIn profile and see if, at any of their previous companies, they&#x2019;ve been promoted. Once is great, twice is amazing and three times is out of this world.</p><p name="b4d5" id="b4d5" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q2: Have they had to lead a big project in a previous role? How did they handle it?</strong></p><p name="f969" id="f969" class="graf--p graf-after--p">A-players like to take on more responsibility over time, not less. Have they had a previous manager that was so confident in their abilities that they were given a large or important project to run on their own?</p><p name="6175" id="6175" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q3: Is this the same role as a previous job or is it somewhat/completely different?</strong></p><p name="fb28" id="fb28" class="graf--p graf-after--p">A-players love challenges. I found that most A-players don&#x2019;t change companies so much as they change roles &#x2014; because they like the challenge of constantly learning new things and being in new situations.</p><p name="b59c" id="b59c" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q4: Can they speak about your company and tell you what they like and what they might change?</strong></p><p name="1a37" id="1a37" class="graf--p graf-after--p">A-players do research on a company before an interview. They try to understand your strategy, what&#x2019;s going well and even what&#x2019;s not. Can they clearly articulate what they like about your company but also provide some constructive feedback on something you might want to change?</p><p name="b8cd" id="b8cd" class="graf--p graf-after--p">If they don&#x2019;t know what your company does or they have no opinion (positive or negative) about it, that&#x2019;s a red flag.</p><p name="4641" id="4641" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q5: Are they confident without being cocky?</strong></p><p name="86b6" id="86b6" class="graf--p graf-after--p">This is a fine line. A-players have great track records and you want someone who talks a lot about being on great teams and having great managers and mentors, not someone constantly saying &#x201C;I this, I that&#x201D;.</p><p name="84ad" id="84ad" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q6: Are they committed to continual learning? Can they prove it?</strong></p><p name="c7d3" id="c7d3" class="graf--p graf-after--p">A-players love learning new skills. Ask them what they learned in their previous role. Ask which book they&#x2019;re currently reading. Ask what they plan to learn in the next 6&#x2013;12 months and how they&#x2019;ll go about doing that.</p><p name="8fae" id="8fae" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Q7: How would you rate the quality and quantity of questions they ask YOU during the interview?</strong></p><p name="3c87" id="3c87" class="graf--p graf-after--p">A great interview is always a conversation &#x2014; it&#x2019;s never one-sided. Look at the quantity and quality of questions they ask YOU. A-players care about the team they&#x2019;ll be on, their manager and where you want to take your company moving forward.</p><p name="5333" id="5333" class="graf--p graf-after--p">If you&#x2019;d like to use these questions in your next interview, I&#x2019;ve put together a swipe file which includes a 70-point rating system you can use to help you assess whether candidates are A-players or not. <a href="http://www.mitchellharper.me/blog/how-to-hire-a-players/" data-href="http://www.mitchellharper.me/blog/how-to-hire-a-players/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Download it here</a> (look for the yellow box). It also includes the specific questions you can ask during the interview, for those of you who aren&#x2019;t sure.</p><p name="6577" id="6577" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Remember, hiring A-players isn&#x2019;t a science. There&#x2019;s a lot more to it than asking the 7 questions above, but in my experience it&#x2019;s a great place to start. You also need to trust your gut, check references, assess if they&#x2019;re a great cultural fit and most importantly ask the people on the team they&#x2019;ll be a part of whether they&#x2019;d like to work with them or not.</p><p name="2671" id="2671" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Want more stuff like this?
