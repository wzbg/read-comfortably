The first thing I needed to do was find MTV. This proved to be one of the hardest things I had attempted all weekend, seeing as how I can&#x2019;t even tell you the last time I watched the channel. But I found it. A sigh of relief echoed across the cushions of my couch.</p> <p>Thanks to social media, I had felt a nagging urge to watch the awards show, although I couldn&#x2019;t really figure out why. Was I watching because I wanted to see who won, because I wanted to see <a href="http://uproxx.com/music/2015/08/miley-cyrus-2015-mtv-vmas-predictions/" target="_blank">what kind of antics Miley would pull</a>, because I wanted to <a href="http://uproxx.com/music/2015/08/vma-2015-highlights-best-worst-performances/">see the performances</a>, or because I&#x2019;m a genius and wanted to save Sunday night&#x2019;s <em>Bachelor in Paradise</em> for Monday so I get a full four hours of it instead of two, two-hour episodes a day apart? Several hours later, and I&#x2019;m still not sure.</p> <p>And, actually, I now have even more questions about the Video Music Awards, questions I&#x2019;m not sure I even want to know the answers to. I narrowed down my list of questions to 10 because, at some point, I need to get on with my life.</p> <p><strong>1) Shouldn&#x2019;t YouTube, Vevo, or Vimeo be hosting the Video Music Awards now?</strong></p> <p>I honestly feel like the whole <em>MTV doesn&#x2019;t even show music videos anymore</em> gag was run into the ground years ago. So, how are they still able to pull this off? If it was the Shows About Teen Pregnancy Awards, then yeah, MTV would have a legitimate case for holding them. But this is like if ESPN stopped showing sports, yet still hosted <a href="http://uproxx.com/topic/espys/" target="_blank">the ESPYs</a>. I&#x2019;m assuming most people watch music videos on either YouTube or Vimeo these days, and, if I were an executive at either of those companies, I&#x2019;d be making a case for snagging the idea of an awards show for music videos from MTV starting today.</p> </div> </div> <!-- Single Post Stream Ad --> <div class="ajax-post-ad view-post">  </div> <div class="post-element-wrapper">  </div> <div class="post-bottom"> <div class="post-topics block-tags"><strong>TAGS</strong><a href="http://uproxx.com/tag/2015-mtv-video-music-awards/">2015 MTV Video Music Awards</a><a href="http://uproxx.com/tag/2015-mtv-vmas/">2015 MTV VMAs</a><a href="http://uproxx.com/tag/mtv-vmas/">MTV VMAS</a></div></div><div id="single-post-related">  <ul class="post_stream"> <div id="wvn_mobile_native">  </div> <li class="post mobile" id="post-1123522"> <div>  </div>  </li> <li class="post mobile" id="post-1123513"> <div>  </div>  </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div><div class="usi-preloader"><img src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/uproxx-mobile/plugins/uproxx-single-infinite/img/ajax-loader.gif" orig-src="https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/uproxx-mobile/plugins/uproxx-single-infinite/img/ajax-loader.gif" use="src"></div>
