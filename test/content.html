<div><h1><a href="/really-simple-file-uploads">Really simple file uploads with Express</a></h1><p class="old-node-warning">HEADS UP! This article was written for an older version of node.&nbsp;More up-to-date information may be available elsewhere.</p><p>Few days ago I was working on a fairly typical web application and I faced the challenge of implementing a fairly
typical web application feature - file uploads. It was the first time I was implementing file uploads with Node (and
Express) and I did what anyone else would do - I googled it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately all the articles / posts out there are either outdated, too complex or plain wrong. So I did the next
most obvious thing - post a question on the mailing list. As always Mr. Holowaychuk was incredibly quick to respond.
His answer lead me to do what I should have done in the first place - read the docs.</p>

<h2>The upload form</h2>

<p>This is the most obvious part of the challenge. You're probably familiar with this already. Anyway, for the sake of
completeness of this article, here it is.</p>

<p>You will need a form in your browser for the file upload. I use Jade to generate my HTML and here how it looks:</p>

<pre><code><span class="pln">form</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">action</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="str">"..."</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> method</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="str">"post"</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> enctype</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="str">"multipart/form-data"</span><span class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; input</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">type</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="str">"file"</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> name</span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="str">"displayImage"</span><span class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"><br></span></code></pre>

<p>The <em>form.action</em> will point to a route that handles the file upload. More below.</p>

<h2>Accessing the uploaded file</h2>

<p>If you're using recents versions of Node and Express, file uploads are a piece of cake. And I'll back this claim but
before we go any further make sure you're familiar with <a href="http://expressjs.com/guide.html">routes, requests and responses in Express</a>.</p>

<p>Okay, now let's justify the "piece of cake" claim. In our file upload route, the <em>req</em> parameter has <em>req.files</em>
available. Here's an example of what the <em>req.files</em> would contain:</p>

<pre><code><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; displayImage</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; size</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">11885</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; path</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'/tmp/1574bb60b4f7e0211fd9ab48f932f3ab'</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; name</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'avatar.png'</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; type</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'image/png'</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; lastModifiedDate</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">Sun</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">05</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="typ">Feb</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">2012</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">05</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="lit">31</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="lit">09</span><span class="pln"> GMT</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; _writeStream</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; path</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'/tmp/1574bb60b4f7e0211fd9ab48f932f3ab'</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; fd</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">14</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; writable</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">false</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; flags</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'w'</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; encoding</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">'binary'</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; mode</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">438</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; bytesWritten</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="lit">11885</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; busy</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">false</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; _queue</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">[],</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; drainable</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">true</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; </span><span class="pun">},</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; length</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="typ">Getter</span><span class="pun">],</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; filename</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="typ">Getter</span><span class="pun">],</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; mime</span><span class="pun">:</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">[</span><span class="typ">Getter</span><span class="pun">]</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">}</span><span class="pln"><br></span></code></pre>

<p>In the <em>req.files</em> object above, the property <em>displayImage</em> is the name of the file field in your HTML form and
<em>req.files</em> will contain one property each for every valid HTML file form field.</p>

<p>The file object contains the <em>type</em>, <em>size</em> and <em>name</em> properties for your server side validations.</p>

<h2>Saving the uploaded file</h2>

<p>Assuming the file is valid, you use the <em>path</em> property for the next step. The <em>path</em> would typically contain a location
in the <em>tmp</em> folder. Your application logic could either require you to access the contents of the file or simply move
the uploaded file to another location.</p>

<pre><code><span class="pln">fs</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">readFile</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">req</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">files</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">displayImage</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">path</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">err</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> data</span><span class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span class="com">// ...</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span class="kwd">var</span><span class="pln"> newPath </span><span class="pun">=</span><span class="pln"> __dirname </span><span class="pun">+</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="str">"/uploads/uploadedFileName"</span><span class="pun">;</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; fs</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">writeFile</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">newPath</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> data</span><span class="pun">,</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="kwd">function</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="pln">err</span><span class="pun">)</span><span class="pln"> </span><span class="pun">{</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; res</span><span class="pun">.</span><span class="pln">redirect</span><span class="pun">(</span><span class="str">"back"</span><span class="pun">);</span><span class="pln"><br>&nbsp; </span><span class="pun">});</span><span class="pln"><br></span><span class="pun">});</span><span class="pln"><br></span></code></pre>

<p>In the <em>fs.readFile</em> callback, we have the <em>data</em> parameter through which we can access the contents of the file. The
example above is taken from an application that needed to modify the file and save it in a new location. Thus
<em>fs.writeFile</em> is used to write <em>data</em> to the <em>newPath</em>.</p>

<p>If your app needs to simply move the uploaded file without modifying the contents <em>fs.rename</em> can be used as more
simpler option.</p>

<hr>

<p>That's all there is to it. I've done file uploads in many server side languages including Python, Java, Scala and PHP
and I don't think its ever been this simple. So much for JavaScript being labeled as an inferior server side language.</p><hr>
