To illustrate his point, he compares it to a Broadway show. In front of the stage, he says, the audience are transported by the drama. Look behind the scenes, however, and you will find the technical engineers, focusing on analysing the technicalities of the event.</p><blockquote><p> People with the condition call themselves &ldquo;alexes&rdquo; </p></blockquote><p>Despite taking centre stage at the ceremony, he felt similarly detached from the tides of emotion swelling up in the people around him. &ldquo;For me, it was a mechanical production,&rdquo; says Caleb (who asked us not to use his full name). Even as his wife walked down the aisle, the only sensation he felt was his face flushing and a heaviness in his feet; his mind was completely clear of joy, happiness, or love in its conventional sense.</p><p>In fact, Caleb claims not to feel almost any emotions &ndash; good, or bad. I meet him through an <a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/exchange-forum\">internet forum for people with &ldquo;alexithymia&rdquo;</a> &ndash; a kind of emotional &ldquo;colour-blindness&rdquo; that prevents them from perceiving or expressing the many shades of feeling that normally embellish our lives. The condition is found in around 50% of people with autism, but many &ldquo;alexes&rdquo; (as they call themselves) such as Cal&shy;&shy;&shy;eb do not show any other autistic traits such as compulsive or repetitive behaviour.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p030263b\"}}</p><blockquote><p> What does it mean to fall in love, when you lack the capacity to feel affection? </p></blockquote><p>Getting to the bottom of this emotional blindness could shed light on many serious illnesses, from anorexia and schizophrenia to chronic pain and irritable bowel syndrome. More personally, stories from the &ldquo;alex community&rdquo; lead you to re-examine experiences that you might think you know so well. How can you fall in love, for example, when you lack all the basic tender feelings of affection that normally spark a romance?</p><p><strong>Shells of feeling</strong></p><p>To understand that emotional numbness, it helps to imagine emotions as a kind of Russian doll, formed of different shells, each one becoming more intricate. At the heart is a bodily sensation &ndash; the skip in your heart when you see the person you love, or the churning stomach that comes with anger. The brain may then attach a value to those feelings &ndash; you know if it is good or bad, and if that feeling is strong, or weak; the amorphous sensations begin to take a shape and form a conscious representation of an emotion. The feelings can be nuanced, perhaps blending different types of emotions, such as bitter-sweet sorrow, and eventually we attach words to them &ndash; you can describe your despair, or your joy, and you can explain how you came to feel that way.</p><p>When alexithymia was first described in 1972, the problem was thought to centre on this last, linguistic stage: deep down people with alexithymia felt the same as everyone else, but they just couldn&rsquo;t put the emotions into words. The scientists hypothesised that this may result from a <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856709632342\">breakdown in communication between the two hemispheres</a>, preventing signals from the emotional regions, predominantly in the right, from reaching the language areas, predominantly in the left. &ldquo;You need that emotional transfer in order to verbalise what you&rsquo;re feeling,&rdquo; says Katharina Goerlich-Dobre at RWTH Aachen University. This could be seen, most dramatically, when surgeons tried to cure epilepsy by cutting the fibres that connect the two hemispheres; although it reduced the seizures, the patients also appeared emotionally mute as a result. Less sensationally, Goerlich-Dobre&rsquo;s brain scans have found that other people with alexithymia seem to have <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26094609\">abnormally dense connections in that neural bridge</a>. This might create a noisy signal (a bit like a badly tuned radio) that prevents emotional cross-talk, she thinks.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p030274k\"}}</p><p>Today, it seems clear that there may be many types of alexithymia. While some might have trouble expressing emotions, others (like Caleb) might not even be conscious of the feelings in the first place. Richard Lane, at the University of Arizona compares it to people who have gone blind after damage to the visual cortex; despite having healthy eyes, they can&rsquo;t see the images. In the same way, a damaged neural circuit involved in emotional processing might prevent <a href=\"http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223%2897%2900050-4/abstract\">sadness</a>, happiness or anger from bursting into consciousness. (Using the analogy of the Russian doll, their emotions are breaking down at the second shell of feeling &ndash; their bodies are reacting normally, but the sensations don&rsquo;t merge to form an emotional thought or feeling.) &ldquo;Maybe the emotion gets activated, you even have the bodily responses, but it happens without you being consciously aware of the emotion,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Along these lines, a few recent fMRI scanning studies have found signs of a more basic perceptual problem in some types of alexithymia. Goerlich-Dobre, for instance, found reduced <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.22879/abstract\">grey matter in areas of the cingulate cortex serving self-awareness</a>, potentially blocking a conscious representation of the emotions. And Andr&eacute; Aleman at the University Medical Centre in Groningen, the Netherlands, detected <a href=\"http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/04/23/scan.nsu056\">some deficits in areas associated with attention</a> when alexithymics look at emotionally charged-pictures; it was as if their brains just weren&rsquo;t registering the feelings. &ldquo;I think this fits quite well with [Lane&rsquo;s] theory,&rdquo; says Aleman &ndash; who had initially suspected other causes. &ldquo;We have to admit they are right.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> The more extreme the emotion I should be feeling, the more it should be colouring how I&rsquo;m thinking. In reality I have a clearer head, I become more analytical &ndash; Caleb </p></blockquote><p>Caleb himself describes a &ldquo;conscious disconnect&rdquo; that prevents emotions from breaking through into his mind. For instance, one day at school he was working with the student theatre. All week he had been struggling to produce the right sound effects, but it just wasn&rsquo;t coming together. Eventually, his boss lost his cool and started ripping into him. &ldquo;My response was that something weird was happening with my body,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I could feel a tension, like my heart was racing, but my mind was distracted&hellip; It was an academic curiosity, and then I completely forgot about the whole situation,&rdquo; he says. It seems that almost no event can penetrate that indifference. &ldquo;The more extreme the emotion I should be feeling, the more it should be colouring how I&rsquo;m thinking. In reality I end up having a clearer head &ndash; I become more analytical.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03027mj\"}}</p><blockquote><p> I can put up with unpleasant experiences because I know I won&rsquo;t have memory associated with it&nbsp;&ndash; Caleb </p></blockquote><p>There is one, slim advantage: he finds it easier to cope with medical procedures, since he doesn&rsquo;t attach the fear, sadness or anxiety to it. &ldquo;I can put up with an awful lot of pain or unpleasant experiences because I know very shortly I won&rsquo;t have an emotional memory associated with it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But it means that positive memories get washed away too.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Neural short circuit</strong></p><p>It is a small pay-off, however: alexithymia seems to be linked to various other illnesses, including schizophrenia and eating disorders, perhaps because emotions normally guide us to take better care of our physical and mental health. Better defining alexithymia could therefore offer insights into these disorders. It could also give us a more nuanced understanding of autism. Despite the stereotypes, <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/site/geoffbirdlab/home\">Geoffrey Bird</a> at Kings College London points out that around half of autistic people are perfectly capable of perceiving and responding to others, and those with social problems tend to also be suffering from alexithymia. For this reason, he thinks that distinguishing the two, distinct, disorders could therefore lead to better guidance. At the moment, misunderstandings can often stand in the way of some autistic people getting the help they need. &ldquo;One autistic adult I worked with wanted to be a carer, but she was told &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t have empathy so can&rsquo;t have the job&rsquo;,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Our research shows that lots of people with autism are fully okay with emotions.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> They are hypersensitive to bodily perceptions, and not able to focus on anything else, which might be one reason why they develop chronic pain </p></blockquote><p>Further work could also pin down the puzzling link to so-called &ldquo;somatic disorders&rdquo;, such as chronic pain and irritable bowel syndrome, that seem to be unusually common in people with alexithymia. Lane suggests it&rsquo;s down to a kind of &ldquo;short-circuit&rdquo; in the brain, created by the emotional blindness. Normally, he says, the conscious perception of emotions can help damp down the physical sensations associated with the feeling. &ldquo;If you can consciously process and allow the feeling to evolve &ndash; if you engage the frontal areas of the brain, you recruit mechanisms that have a top down, modulatory effect on bodily processes,&rdquo; says Lane. Without the emotional outlet, however, the mind could get stuck on the physical feelings, potentially amplifying the responses. As Goerlich-Dobre puts it: &ldquo;They are hypersensitive to bodily perceptions, and not able to focus on anything else, which might be one reason why they develop chronic pain.&rdquo; (Some studies, have in fact found that <a href=\"http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1751-0759-7-1.pdf\">alexes are often abnormally sensitive to bodily sensations</a>, although <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J094v13n03_05#preview\">other experiments have found conflicting evidence</a>.)</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03027bj\"}}</p><p>Physical sensations certainly seem to dominate Caleb&rsquo;s descriptions of difficult events, such as periods of separation from his family. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t miss people, as far as I can tell. If I&rsquo;m gone, and don&rsquo;t see someone for a long period, it&rsquo;s a case of out of sight, out of mind,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I do feel physically a kind of pressure or stress when I&rsquo;m not around my wife or my child for a couple of days.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Reconnecting to lost feelings</strong></p><p>The hope is that eventually, doctors may be able to track down the origins of alexithymia and stop the effects from snow-balling. Caleb thinks his alexithymia emerged at birth and could be genetic. Upbringing &ndash; and the emotional fluency of your parents &ndash; may also play a role, while for others, it may be caused by trauma that shuts down people&rsquo;s ability to process some or all of their emotions.</p><p>Lane, for instance, introduced me to one of his patients, Patrick Dust, who was the subject of violent abuse from his alcoholic father &ndash; experiences that put his life in danger. &ldquo;One night, when he came home, my mother and he had another intense verbal argument. He said 'I&rsquo;m going to get my shotgun and kill all of you'&hellip; We ran to a neighbour&rsquo;s house where we called the police.&rdquo; For decades afterwards, he found it difficult to interpret and understand his emotions, particularly the fear and the anger he still felt towards his parents. He suspects this resulted in his fibromyalgia &ndash; chronic diffuse pain and tenderness across the whole body &ndash; and an eating disorder.</p><blockquote><p> I discovered the tremendous anger I had felt, without much awareness of it. It&rsquo;s the most important thing I&rsquo;ve done in my life &ndash; Patrick Dust </p></blockquote><p>With initial guidance from Lane and later by himself, Dust was able to revisit the past and reconnect to the emotions he was locking away, which he thinks also brought some relief to the fibromyalgia. &ldquo;I discovered the tremendous anger I had felt, without much awareness of it,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the most important thing I&rsquo;ve done in my life.&rdquo; He has just finished writing a book about the process.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p03027ws\"}}</p><p>Caleb, too, has visited a cognitive behavioural therapist to help with his social understanding, and through conscious effort he is now better able to analyse the physical feelings and to equate it with emotions that other people may feel. Although it remains a somewhat academic exercise, the process helps him to try to grasp his wife&rsquo;s feelings and to see why she acts the way she does.</p><p>Not everyone with alexithymia may have his determination and patience, however. Nor may they find a life partner who is willing to make the allowances his condition requires. &ldquo;It takes a lot of understanding on my wife&rsquo;s part&hellip; She understands that my conceptions of things like love are a bit different,&rdquo; he says. In return, she may benefit from his stability &ndash; he is not swayed by the fickle tides of feelings. &ldquo;The trade-off is that my relationship with my wife is a conscious choice,&rdquo; he says &ndash; he is not acting on a whim but a very deliberate decision to care for her. That has been particularly helpful in the last eight months. &ldquo;It means that if we&rsquo;re going through a difficult situation &ndash; if the kid&rsquo;s up all night crying &ndash; for me that doesn&rsquo;t affect our relationship at all, because the connection isn&rsquo;t built on emotion,&rdquo; says Caleb.</p><p>Caleb may not have been transported to ecstasy by his wedding or the birth of his child, but he has spent most of his life looking within, striving to feel and understand the sensations of himself and the people around him. The result is that he is certainly one of the most thoughtful, and self-aware, people I have ever had the pleasure of interviewing &ndash; someone who seems to know himself, and his limitations, inside out.</p><p>Ultimately, he wants to emphasise that emotional blindness does not make one unkind, or selfish. &ldquo;It may be hard to believe, but it is possible for someone to be cut off completely from the emotions and imagination that are such a big part of what makes us humans,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And that a person can be cut off from emotions without being heartless, or a psychopath.&rdquo;</p><p><em>David Robson is BBC Future&rsquo;s feature writer.

More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\">accent and articulation</a> &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}</p><p>But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.</p><p>Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Infectious giggles</strong></p><p>That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\">to open up about personal information</a> &ndash; paving more common ground between people.</p><p>Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\">laughter correlates with increased pain threshold</a>, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.</p><p>Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}</p><p>For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.</p><p>Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.</p><p>You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\">asking visitors of different ages to judge</a> the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}</p><p>Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.</p><p>Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:</p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p><p>Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;</p><p>Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.</p><p>So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.</p><p>Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a <a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\">charity gig</a> the following evening, she is very funny.</p><p>As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><blockquote><p>Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.</p></blockquote>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

He had gym in the morning, where he played volleyball for 45 minutes. He then entered his office to clear a backlog of emails, before heading to the dentist&rsquo;s for root-canal surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember getting into the chair and the dentist inserting the local anaesthetic,&rdquo; he tells me. After that? A complete blank.</p><blockquote><p> It is as if all new memories are being written in invisible ink that slowly disappears. </p></blockquote><p>Since then, he has been unable to remember almost anything for longer than 90 minutes. So while he can still tell me about the first time he met the Duke of York for a briefing at the Ministry of Defence, he can&rsquo;t even remember where he&rsquo;s living now; he wakes up every morning believing he is still in Germany in 2005, waiting to visit the dentist. Without a record of new experiences, the passing of time means nothing to him. Today, he only knows that there is a problem because he and his wife have written detailed notes on his smartphone, in a file labelled &ldquo;First thing &ndash; read this&rdquo;.</p><p>It is as if all new memories are being written in invisible ink that slowly disappears. How could minor dental work have affected his brain in such a profound way? This real-life medical mystery offers a rare glimpse at the hidden depths of the brain&rsquo;s workings.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzr8k\"}}</p><p>Even the events leading up to William&rsquo;s amnesia are highly puzzling. At the time of the surgery, the dentist didn&rsquo;t realise that anything was wrong; it was only after they asked him to take off his protective dark glasses that they saw he was pale, and struggled to stand up. They called his wife. &ldquo;He was lying on a couch,&rdquo; Samantha recalls. (Both their names have been altered to preserve the family's privacy). &ldquo;His eyes were staring; he looked surprised to see me &ndash; he had no clue what was going on.&rdquo; By 5pm he was removed to hospital, where he stayed for three days. Even after some of the mental fog dissipated, he was still unable to recall anything for more than a few minutes.</p><p>The doctors initially suspected that he&rsquo;d reacted badly to the anaesthetic, causing a brain haemorrhage &ndash; yet they failed to find evidence of injury. So he was discharged with the mystery still hanging over him, and the family moved back to England, where he was referred to the office of <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/psychology/ppl/gb222\">Gerald Burgess</a>, a clinical psychologist in Leicester.</p><p><strong>The brain&rsquo;s printing press</strong></p><p>The obvious explanation would have been that William had a form of &ldquo;anterograde amnesia&rdquo;, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison\">Henry Molaison</a>, whose experiences have informed much of what we know about memory. During brain surgery to treat his epilepsy, surgeons sliced out a large chunk of Molaison&rsquo;s grey matter, including his hippocampi &ndash; seahorse-shaped regions at the centre of the brain. They act as our memory&rsquo;s printing press, stamping the &ldquo;episodic memories&rdquo; of events into long-term storage &ndash; and without them, Molaison was unable to hold on to anything that occurred after the surgery.</p><blockquote><p> William could work out how to solve a complex maze, only to completely forget the skill three days later. </p></blockquote><p>Yet as William&rsquo;s first doctors had noted, brain scans seemed to show that these crucial areas were still intact. Nor did his symptoms exactly match those of other anterograde amnesiacs. While Molaison couldn&rsquo;t remember details of personal events, for instance, he could learn new &ldquo;procedural&rdquo; skills since they are processed in different parts of the brain. When Burgess asked William to work out how to solve a complex maze, however, he had completely forgotten the skill three days later. &ldquo;It was like a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu replica of the same errors &ndash; he took the same time to relearn the task once more,&rdquo; says Burgess.</p><p>One possibility is that William&rsquo;s amnesia is a &ldquo;psychogenic illness&rdquo;. Some patients report memory loss after a traumatic event &ndash; but that tends to be a coping mechanism to avoid thinking about painful past events; it doesn&rsquo;t normally affect your ability to remember the present. Samantha says that William had suffered no trauma, and according to Burgess&rsquo;s detailed psychiatric assessments, he is otherwise emotionally healthy. &ldquo;He was a successful father and military officer with good job evaluations,&rdquo; says Burgess. &ldquo;There was no reason to think that there was anything wrong psychiatrically.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzqmd\"}}</p><p>Given the evidence, Burgess instead suspects the answer may be hiding in the thicket of tiny neural connections we call &ldquo;synapses&rdquo;. Once we have experienced an event, the memories are slowly cemented in the long term by altering these richly woven networks. That process of &ldquo;consolidation&rdquo; involves the production of new proteins to rebuild the synapses in their new shape; without it, the memory remains fragile and is easily eroded with time. Block that protein synthesis in rats, and they soon forget anything they have just learnt. Crucially, 90 minutes would be about the right time for this consolidation to take place &ndash; just as William starts to forget the details of the event. Rather than losing its printing press, like Molaison, William's brain seems to have simply run out of ink.</p><p>Even so, it&rsquo;s not clear why root canal surgery should have made his brain run dry in this way. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the million-pound question&rdquo;, says Burgess, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t have an answer.&rdquo; Scouring the medical literature, he found five similar cases of mysterious memory loss without brain damage. Although none occurred during a trip to the dentist, they do seem to follow other periods of physiological stress during a medical emergency. &ldquo;It could be a genetic predisposition that needs a catalyst event to start the process,&rdquo; says Burgess.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzrck\"}}</p><p>Burgess hopes that his new paper, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25978125\">which appears in Neurocase journal</a>, will encourage other psychologists to share similar stories and perhaps spark other theories. They are already intrigued. &ldquo;It is a bit of a head scratcher,&rdquo; admits <a href=\"http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/academics/aggleton.php\">John Aggleton, at Cardiff University</a> in the UK. He would like to see more detailed tests, looking more specifically at the long-distance connectivity of the brain. Even if there&rsquo;s no damage to the brain cells themselves, William may be missing some of the necessary wiring around the hippocampi and other parts of the memory processing pipeline, he thinks.</p><p>For the time being, William helps to remind us just how little we know about our own minds. Mesmerised by colourful MRI scans, many now think of the brain as a kind of computer, with separate chips devoted &ldquo;memory&rdquo;, &ldquo;fear&rdquo; or &ldquo;sex&rdquo;. &nbsp;Yet William perfectly demonstrates why this modular view of the mind is over-simplistic. Even when all that machinery is apparently intact, you can still find yourself lost in the present, with no way of bridging the past and the future. Clearly, the brain has many more layers to be peeled away before we can get to the heart of what makes us who we are.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzqdm\"}}</p><blockquote><p> In the last 10 years, William has been able to cling to one new fact &ndash; his father&rsquo;s death. </p></blockquote><p>William also demonstrates just how the powerfully our emotions shape our minds. In the last 10 years, he has been able to cling to one new fact &ndash; his father&rsquo;s death. Somehow, the force of his grief helped him to forge new tracks in the brain and grasp on to that fact, when everything else has slipped away.

It&rsquo;s as if the memories of drug abuse, bankruptcy and homelessness had been wiped from her mind. In fact, she says her last memory was of going to sleep as a teenager in the bunk bed she used to share with her sister, and of thinking about her upcoming French exam.</p><p>Eight weeks later her memories returned, but before they did, Jacobs says she had to negotiate the 21st Century world as her 15-year-old self. This meant learning to use &ldquo;new&rdquo; technologies like smart phones, but most challenging of all, it meant coming to terms with the fact that she had a 10-year-old son.</p><p>Jacobs&rsquo; incredible story is told in her forthcoming book Forgotten Girl and you can hear her talk in this <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02p1vbm\">BBC interview</a>.</p><p><strong>Split minds</strong></p><p>From a medical perspective, Jacobs&rsquo; memory loss is considered to be a case of dissociative amnesia. This means there is no physiological explanation for why she temporarily lost 17 years&rsquo; worth of memories. Instead, the forgetting is psychological (or &ldquo;psychogenic&rdquo;), possibly brought on by recent or historical stress and trauma. Consistent with this, Jacobs says that not only had she lost her business and abused drugs in those forgotten years, she was raped at age six, and a boyfriend tried to strangle her when she was 20.</p><p>Dissociative amnesia is a controversial diagnosis. Some scholars, such as Harvard psychiatrist Harrison Pope, dispute that it really exists. They point out that there are no historical references to the condition prior to 1800.&nbsp; Other sceptics <a href=\"http://www.haraldmerckelbach.nl/artikelen_engels/2012/Dissociation%20And%20Dissociative%20Disorders.pdf\">propose that the dissociative disorders</a> (including dissociative identity disorder, previously known as multiple identity disorder) are not so much an automatic coping strategy triggered by trauma, but rather more a consequence of the patients&rsquo; expectations for how they ought to behave, prompted in part by therapists&rsquo; suggestions and fictional portrayals of illness.</p><p>Complementing this picture, people diagnosed with dissociative disorders typically also have diagnoses of personality disorders and emotional instabilities. They also tend to score highly in suggestibility and fantasy proneness. At the time of her memory loss, Jacobs was studying psychology, which may have exposed her to ideas about trauma and memory functioning. In an <a href=\"http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/Magazine/article1540495.ece\">interview with the Sunday Times</a>, she says she has &ldquo;great reverence&rdquo; for the mind. &ldquo;I know that my way of dealing with trauma is for my mind to split,&rdquo; she adds.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ptj4l\"}}</p><p>The power of a <a href=\"http://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/09/woman-whose-new-memories-are-erased.html\">patient&rsquo;s expectations </a>&nbsp;certainly seems to lie behind another striking case. After a car crash, the patient reported that her memories were wiped clean each night. This is a symptom that makes no physiological sense but it&rsquo;s precisely what happens to Drew Barrymore&rsquo;s character after a crash in the film 50 First Dates, released in 2004. Crucially, when the researchers tricked the patient, testing her on material that she thought was from the same day, but was really from the day before, her performance was unimpaired. The researchers don&rsquo;t think the woman &ndash; a Drew Barrymore fan &ndash;&nbsp;was malingering (although other experts are more sceptical), but they do think the manifestation of her psychogenic amnesia was likely influenced by the portrayal of memory loss in the film.</p><p>These cases of psychogenic or dissociative amnesia are relatively rare. More common is organic amnesia, of the kind caused by damage to the brain or neurological illness, such as stroke. When these kinds of patients present at the clinic, their problem isn&rsquo;t usually that they&rsquo;ve forgotten episodes from their past, or that they&rsquo;ve lost their identity; it&rsquo;s that they are unable to form new memories.</p><p><strong>Stuck in the present</strong></p><p>So-called &ldquo;anterograde amnesia&rdquo; of this kind is usually caused by damage to the hippocampus &ndash;&nbsp;a structure housed in each of the temporal lobes (near the ears) that plays an important part in memory. Probably the most studied amnesiac is the late Henry Molaison. A surgeon removed large parts of his hippocampi (and both his amygdalae) as part of a radical treatment for his epilepsy, conducted in 1953. The procedure&nbsp;stopped the&nbsp;seizures but left him permanently stuck in the present.</p><p>Although he knew his identity and could remember some past episodes, most of his new memories never lasted more than a few seconds. Brenda Milner, who studied Molaison for years, has described how he greeted her as a stranger each day. After eating a meal, he would sit down to eat another half an hour later &ndash; and he couldn&rsquo;t remember his plans from one moment to the next. Researchers also discovered that Molaison had unusually high pain tolerance (they tested this by subjecting his arm to heat from a hair-dryer-like contraption). Our experience of pain is related in part to our memory of past painful experiences, so it's possible that Molaison's pain tolerance was affected by the removal of his amygdalae, a brain structure involved in remembering previous painful episodes.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02pthn4\"}}</p><p>Other forms of organic amnesia are brought about by concussion, and heavy drug and alcohol use. Although many alcohol-induced blackouts are triggered by a single episode, long-term alcoholism can also cause a condition known as Korsakoff&rsquo;s syndrome, that disrupts both memories from the past and the formation of new memories from the present. The patients often fill the gaps in their past with confabulated stories &ndash; these are totally fictional, but they seem to believe them to be true. <strong><br /> </strong><br /> More rare is transient global amnesia, which is when memory loss is caused by a temporary drop in blood flow to parts of the brain involved in memory function. The causes of this kind of disrupted blood flow can vary and, according to a report published in 2011, include <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18829203\">energetic intercourse</a>. In this case, a 54-year-old woman claimed that she had lost all her memories from the 24-hour-period prior to climaxing: that&rsquo;s what you call mind-blowing sex.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ptjc3\"}}</p><p>In a sense, we are all amnesiacs: it is rare for most people to recall the first three or four years of their lives. It&rsquo;s not that we are incapable of forming long-term memories at this early age (three-year-olds, for example, can happily reminisce about earlier memories), but somehow these recollections are lost as we grow into later childhood and adolescence. A recent study suggested that the infantile amnesia process kicks in at around the age of seven and may be a side-effect of the <a href=\"http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/01/childhood-amnesia-kicks-in-around-age-7.html\">maturation of memory functioning</a>. Curiously, though, there&rsquo;s evidence that infantile amnesia is to some <a href=\"http://digest.bps.org.uk/2010/09/woman-whose-new-memories-are-erased.html\">extent influenced by culture</a>. For instance, first memories are earlier among the New Zealand Maori than among New Zealand citizens of European descent and Asian people, perhaps because Maori cultures place so much emphasis on story-telling about the past.</p><p>That smudge in our early memories is nothing compared to the experiences of people with more serious forms of amnesia &ndash; for many, it feels like a gaping chasm in their lives. Our recollections are the very core of our being, around which we build our identity, our relationships, our hopes and our dreams. When we lose our memories, we really lose ourselves.</p><p><em>Dr Christian Jarrett edits the British Psychological Society's <a href=\"http://digest.bps.org.uk/\">Research Digest</a> blog.

It was the beating of his &ldquo;second heart&rdquo;.</p><p>The small mechanical pump was meant to relieve the burden of his failing cardiac muscles, but Carlos (not his real name) disliked the sensation. The beat of the machine seemed to replace his pulse, a sensation that warped his body image: as the device throbbed above his navel, Carlos had the eerie feeling that his chest had dropped into the abdomen.</p><p>It was a strange, unsettling feeling. But when neuroscientist Agustin Ibanez met Carlos, he suspected even odder effects were to come. By changing the man&rsquo;s heart, Ibanez thought, the doctors might have also changed their patient&rsquo;s mind: Carlos would now think, feel and act differently as a result of the implant.</p><p>How come? We often talk about &ldquo;following the heart&rdquo;, but it is only recently that scientists have begun to show that there is literal truth in the cliche; the heaving lump of muscle contributes to our emotions and the mysterious feelings of &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; in a very real way. Everything from your empathy for another person&rsquo;s pain to the hunch that your spouse is having an affair may originate from subtle signals in your heart and the rest of your body.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23887813\">the man who feels two hearts</a> offered Ibanez, who is based at Favaloro University in Buenos Aires, a unique opportunity to test those ideas.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Cranial stuffing&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ibanez&rsquo;s work chimes with millennia of speculation about the heart&rsquo;s role in cognition &ndash; which was sometimes thought to supersede the brain&rsquo;s. Touching the cool, moist grey matter of the cortex, for instance, <a href=\"http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/jspui/bitstream/1880/47541/1/Reynolds_2007.pdf\">Aristotle assumed that the brain&rsquo;s main function was to chill the passions erupting from the heart</a> &ndash; which he considered the seat of the soul. For similar reasons, embalmers in ancient Egyptians made sure to leave the heart in the chest, but happily removed the mere &ldquo;cranial stuffing&rdquo; from the head.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhfl\"}}</p><p>We now take a more cerebral view of thought, even if the view of the heart as the font of our emotions has lingered; just consider the many metaphors we use to describe feelings today. William James, the founder of modern psychology, helped formalise these ideas in the 19th Century by suggesting that emotions are really a back-and-forth feedback cycle between the body and the brain. According to his theory, the brain might be able to register a threat intellectually &ndash; but it is our awareness of the racing heartbeat and sweaty palms that transforms an abstract concept into a visceral emotion.</p><p>James&rsquo; ideas also raised an important question: if everybody has different bodily awareness, would that shape the emotions they experience? The idea was difficult to test, however, but a hundred years later scientists are now on the case.</p><p>The studies first asked subjects to count their heartbeats based solely on the feelings within their chest; they weren&rsquo;t allowed to put their hand on their heart or actively take their pulse. Try it for yourself, and you&rsquo;ll see that this kind of &ldquo;interoception&rdquo; can be surprisingly difficult; around one in four people miss the mark by about 50%, suggesting they have little to no perception of the movements inside them; only a quarter get 80% accuracy. After testing their cardiac awareness, the researchers then gave the volunteers various cognitive tests.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhqz\"}}</p><p>James, it turned out, was spot on. People with more bodily awareness tend have <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16729289\">more intense reactions to emotive pictures</a> and report being more greatly moved by them; they are also better at describing their feelings. Importantly, this sensitivity seems to extend to others&rsquo; feelings &ndash; they <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559130\">are better at recognising emotions in others&rsquo; faces</a> &ndash; and they are also quicker to learn to avoid a threat, such as a small electric shock in the lab, perhaps because those more intense bodily feelings saturate their memories, making the aversion more visceral. &ldquo;It may quickly clue us in to the relative goodness or badness of the objects, choices, or avenues of action that we are facing,&rdquo; says Daniella Furman at the University of California, Berkeley. In other words, people who are in tune with their bodies have a richer, more vivid emotional life &ndash; including both the ups and downs of life. &ldquo;We may not be able to describe the particular physiological signature of a pleasurable experience, but we would probably recognise the sensations when they occur,&rdquo; she says.</p><p><strong>Emotional barometer</strong></p><p>These <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106893\">secret bodily signals may also lie behind our intuition</a> &ndash; the indefinable hunches that you have the winning hand in poker, say, according to an elegant study by Barney Dunn at the University of Exeter. The task was simple: the volunteers were asked to choose cards from four decks, and they would win money if it matched the colour of another, upturned card.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhbg\"}}</p><p>The game was rigged so that you were slightly more likely to win from two of the decks, and lose if you picked from the other two. Dunn found that the people who could track their heartbeat with the most accuracy would tend to pick from certain decks, whereas those with poor interoception were more likely to choose at random.&nbsp;</p><p>The bodily-aware people weren&rsquo;t always correct &ndash; they were the worst losers as well as the best winners &ndash; but the point was that they were more likely to follow their hunches.</p><p>So the folklore may be right: people who are in touch with their heart are more likely to be swayed by their instincts &ndash; for good or bad. All of which prompted Ibanez to wonder what would happen when you are fitted with an artificial heart? If Carlos experienced substantial changes, it would offer important new evidence that our mind extends well beyond the brain.</p><p>And that is exactly what he found. When Carlos tapped out his pulse, for instance, he followed the machine&rsquo;s rhythms rather than his own heartbeat. The fact that this also changed other perceptions of his body &ndash; seeming to expand the size of his chest, for instance &ndash; is perhaps to be expected; in some ways, changing the position of the heart was creating a sensation not unlike the famous &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/visualized-heartbeat-out-of-body-experience/28728/\">rubber hand illusion</a>&rdquo;. But crucially, it also seemed to have markedly altered certain social and emotional skills. Carlos seemed to lack empathy when he viewed pictures of people having a painful accident, for instance. He also had more general problems with his ability to read other&rsquo;s motives, and, crucially, intuitive decision making &ndash; all of which is in line with the idea that the body rules emotional cognition. &ldquo;It is a very interesting, very intriguing study,&rdquo; says Dunn of the findings.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A lifeless shell&rdquo;</p><p></strong></p><p>Sadly, Carlos died from complications during later treatments &ndash; but Ibanez now hopes to continue his studies with other patients. He is currently performing tests on people undergoing a full heart transplant to see how it could influence interoception. Damage to the vagal nerve should cut off some of the internal signals sent from the heart to the brain, which might then impact their cognition.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhd7\"}}</p><p>Away from the cardiac clinic, he is also looking at whether a fault in the link between body and brain could lead to strange depersonalisation disorders, in which patients have the eerie feeling that they don&rsquo;t inhabit their own body. &ldquo;I feel as though I'm not alive, as though my body is an empty, lifeless shell,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1025389031000138538\">one patient told researchers</a>. &ldquo;I seem to be walking in a world I recognise but don't feel.&rdquo; Ibanez has found that they tend to show worse interoception, and brain scans suggest that this results from a breakdown in communication across the anterior insula &ndash; a deep fold of the cortex that is, tellingly, implicated in <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098769\">body awareness, emotion perception, empathy, decision making &ndash; and the sense of self</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Dunn, who is a clinical psychologist, is more concerned about its relevance to depression. &ldquo;At the moment therapy is very much in the head &ndash; we change what the client thinks and trust that their emotions will follow up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I often hit a wall: they say that they know these things intellectually, but emotionally they can&rsquo;t feel it.&rdquo;</p><p>Even after therapy has trained more positive thinking, the patient may still struggle to feel joy, for example &ndash; a problem that Dunn suspects may come from poor interoception. He gives the example that when you are walking around the park, your body might give you all sorts of pleasant feedback that shows you are relaxed and peaceful. &ldquo;But depressed clients seem to walk around the park without being engaged with the sensory experience,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and then they come back and say it was flat and empty&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkj1d\"}}</p><p>Along these lines, Furman has found that people with major depressive disorder (but without other complications like anxiety) struggle to feel their own heart beat; and the poorer their awareness, the less likely they were to report positive experiences in their daily life. And as Dunn&rsquo;s work on decision making would have suggested, poor body perception also seemed to be linked to measures of indecision &ndash; a problem that blights many people with depression. Furman stresses, however, that there may be many different kinds of depression, and poor bodily awareness may only influence some of them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not clear why some people may have reduced bodily awareness, but Dunn thinks it can be trained, with practice. He is currently looking into the use of mindfulness-based therapy, which encourages people to focus on the sensations in their body. He says the challenge is to try to recognise the feelings, even if they are unpleasant, without reacting to them in a knee-jerk way. You should then be better equipped to use the body as the &ldquo;emotional barometer&rdquo; to inform you about your state of mind and decide how to act. Another group has <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038304\">designed a rudimentary computer game</a> that asks you to tap a key with every four heartbeats, and flashes red when you are wrong, offering feedback that should boost body awareness.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? You can enjoy a richer, more emotional life; tune into the sensory pleasures of the world, and make better decisions. And all you have to do is listen to your heart.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20141205-the-man-with-two-hearts&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2d%2Fkh%2Fp02dkh7c.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\"><em>Share this story on Facebook</em></a><em>, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-05T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The mind-bending effects of feeling two hearts ","HeadlineShort":"The man with two hearts","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"When a man was fitted with a new heart, his mind changed in unusual ways.

It has also been used in Laurel &amp; Hardy and Tarzan the Tiger, among others.

This can happen, but it's rare. Cases like these, and more common ones where individuals suffer partial-memory loss, are called retrograde amnesia. More common still is anterograde amnesia, which means people have difficulty forming new memories of the things that happen after their accident.

However, it is true that people who suffer one traumatic brain injury are statistically <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20100122\">more likely to have a second</a>. A person&rsquo;s attention or balance might have been affected in the initial accident, making a second more likely. For others of course, it is simply the fact that they <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14625331\">continue to take part in high risk sports</a> or have dangerous jobs, which makes them more likely than the average member of the public to sustain another injury.</p><p>A second blow to the head not only fails to cure the symptoms of the first, but could <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6737652\">leave the brain more vulnerable</a> and increase the likelihood of a second injury being fatal. This is known as second impact syndrome, but it is based on such a small number of cases that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2672291/\">the diagnosis is controversial</a>. There have been a few isolated cases of young people returning to sport after recovering from a concussion, getting hit on the head for a second time, and suddenly dying. These incidents have driven the <a href=\"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/rerp/2012/659652/#B4\">guidelines</a> in the National Football League in the US for the length of break a player must take before participating again after they&rsquo;ve been knocked unconscious. Others, such as the neurologist Paul McCrory, of the University of Melbourne, believe second impact syndrome to be <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11495318\">a myth</a>. He doesn&rsquo;t doubt the seriousness of the situation, but questions the evidence connecting these deaths to the initial injuries. Instead he thinks these sudden deaths are caused by a swelling across the brain <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22236821\">due to the second injury alone</a>.</p><p>Whoever is proved right in the long-run, it is clear that second injuries don&rsquo;t help with amnesia.&nbsp;But there is one other condition which might explain where we get the popular idea that a second accident can bring memories flooding back. Patients with a rare and poorly understood psychiatric condition known as a <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/17/health/psychology/17brody.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=9f74bc372a35d026&amp;ex=1334462400&amp;adxnnl=0&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1176896055-n0YWXYXrdY/qxuSHON02xA&amp;_r=0\">dissociative fugue state</a>, or simply fugue, can forget everything about their lives, including their own name, following an extremely traumatic event.</p><p>Occasionally individuals with the condition turn up in a new town, with no idea who they are. Eventually their memory returns, and it&rsquo;s not understood exactly why. Afterwards their recollections of the time when their memory was absent might remain a blur. This fits in better with the pattern you tend to see in films, and may explain the origin of the myth. But neither the initial loss of memory, nor its recovery are caused by a physical blow to the head.</p><p>So while the dramatic potential of complete memory loss sandwiched between two accidents is unquestionable, its basis in reality certainly is.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook page</em></a><em> or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>. </em></p><p><em>You can hear more Medical Myths on </em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002vsyw\"><em>Health Check on the BBC World Service</em></a><em>. </em></p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong></p><p>All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

Simon Baker entered the bathroom to see if a warm shower could ease his pain. &ldquo;I looked up at the shower head, and it was as if the water droplets had stopped in mid-air&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;They came into hard focus rapidly, over the course of a few seconds&rdquo;. Where you&rsquo;d normally perceive the streams as more of a blur of movement, he could see each one hanging in front of him, distorted by the pressure of the air rushing past. The effect, he recalls, was very similar to the way the bullets travelled in the Matrix movies. &ldquo;It was like a high-speed film, slowed down.&rdquo;</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140626-your-amazing-time-warp-stories\">See readers' stories of how they experienced time standing still</a></li></ul><p>The next day, Baker went to hospital, where doctors found that he had suffered an aneurysm. The experience was soon overshadowed by the more immediate threat to his health, but in a follow-up appointment, he happened to mention what happened to his neurologist, Fred Ovsiew at Northwestern University in Chicago, who was struck by the vivid descriptions. &ldquo;He was a very bright guy, and very eloquent&rdquo; says Ovsiew, who recently wrote about Baker in the journal <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557277\">NeuroCase</a>. (Baker&rsquo;s identity was anonymised, which is typical for such studies, so this is not his real name).</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kc63\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to assume that time flows at the same rate for everybody, but experiences like Baker&rsquo;s show that our continuous stream of consciousness is a fragile illusion, stitched together by the brain&rsquo;s clever editing. By studying what happens during such extreme events, researchers are revealing how and why the brain plays these temporal tricks &ndash; and in some circumstances, they suggest, all of us can experience time warping.</p><p>Although Baker is perhaps the most dramatic case, a smattering of strikingly similar accounts can be found, intermittently, in medical literature. There are reports of time speeding up &ndash; so called &ldquo;zeitraffer&rdquo; phenomenon &ndash; and also more fragmentary experiences called &ldquo;akinetopsia&rdquo;, in which motion momentarily stops. For instance, travelling home one day, one 61-year-old woman reported that the <a href=\"http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/61428/1/61428.pdf\">movement of the closing train doors, and fellow passengers, was in slow motion and &ldquo;broken up&rdquo;, as if in &ldquo;freeze frames&rdquo;</a>. A 58-year-old Japanese man, meanwhile, seemed to be experiencing life like a badly dubbed movie; in conversation, he found that although <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213323213000236\">others&rsquo; voices sounded normal, they were out of sync with their faces</a>. There may be many more unreported cases, says Ovsiew. &ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s a transient phenomenon, it could often be overlooked.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kc87\"}}</p><p>Such experiences almost always accompany problems like epilepsy or stroke. Baker was only 39 at the time of his experience, which seems to have been caused by a weakened blood vessel that began bleeding while he was carrying some heavy boxes. The result was a relatively large patch of neural damage in the right hemisphere. &ldquo;In the scans, it looks like there&rsquo;s a cigar in my head,&rdquo; he jokes today.</p><p>Yet why did this affect Baker&rsquo;s time perception? Some clues could come from studies that have attempted to pinpoint the regions responsible for our perception of time. Of particular interest is an area of the visual cortex, called V5. This region, which lies towards the back of the skull, has long been known to detect the motion of objects, but perhaps it has a more general role in measuring the passing of time. When Domenica Bueti and colleagues at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland zapped the area with a magnetic field to knock out its activity, her subjects found it tricky to do two things: they struggled to track the motion of dots on a screen, as would be expected, &nbsp;but also found it <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/30/12423\">hard to estimate how long some blue dots appeared too. </a></p><p>One explanation for this double-failure is that our motion perception system has its own stopwatch, recording how fast things are moving across our vision &ndash; and when this is disrupted by brain injury, the world stands still. For Baker, stepping into the shower might have exacerbated the problem, since the warm water would have drawn the blood away from the brain to the extremities of the body, further disturbing the brain&rsquo;s processing.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kcng\"}}</p><p>It is just one possibility; not all patients with time warping experiences have damage to V5, so other cogs in the brain&rsquo;s time-keeping apparatus may also play a role.</p><p>Another explanation comes from the discovery that our brain records its perceptions in discrete &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo;, like the frames of a film reel. &ldquo;The healthy brain reconstructs the experience and glues together the different frames,&rdquo; says <a href=\"http://cerco.ups-tlse.fr/~rufin/index_files/contact.htm\">Rufin VanRullen at the French Centre for Brain and Cognition Research</a> in Toulouse, &ldquo;but if brain damage destroys the glue, you might only see the snapshots.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kcs2\"}}</p><p>We may all experience the normal smooth picture breaking down occasionally. For starters, if you&rsquo;ve ever looked at overtaking cars on the motorway, their <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002911\">wheels can seem to stand still</a>. This happens because the brain&rsquo;s intermittent snapshots fail to capture the wheel&rsquo;s motion fully. If, for example, it has made a full rotation between each &ldquo;frame&rdquo;, it will seem to be in exactly the same position each snapshot, giving the illusion that it is stationary.</p><p>And users of LSD often report &ldquo;visual trails&rdquo; following moving objects, a bit like the trails of bullets in The Matrix movie. VanRullen suspects this might arise because the <a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001056\">brain somehow overlaps those sensory snapshots</a>, rather than refreshing its picture anew.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kd2n\"}}</p><p>Reports of time standing still are also common during a life-threatening accident; in one survey of people who had skirted close to death, more than 70% reported the feeling that the event occurred in slow motion. Some researchers claim that they are simply an artefact of memory, since the <a href=\"http://edge.org/conversation/brain-time\">intense emotions lead us to lay down more details</a>, so that we believe that the event lasted for longer only in hindsight. But the descriptions certainly sound close to those reported by the neurological patients, suggesting there may be some overlap.</p><p>For example, one person told researchers in the 1970s how they <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010440X77900104\">vividly remembered seeing the face of a train&rsquo;s engineer during a near fatal collision</a>: &ldquo;It was like a movie run slowly so the frames progress with a jerky motion &ndash; that was how I saw the face&rdquo;.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, Valtteri Arstila at University of Turku, Finland, points out that many of these subjects also report abnormally quick thinking. As one pilot, who&rsquo;d faced a plane crash in the Vietnam War, put it: &ldquo;when the nose-wheel strut collapsed I vividly recalled, in a matter of about three seconds, over a dozen actions necessary to successful recovery of flight attitude&rdquo;. Reviewing the case studies and available scientific research on the matter, Arstila concludes that <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00196/full\">an automatic mechanism, triggered by stress hormones, might speed up the brain&rsquo;s internal processing to help it handle the life or death situation</a>. &ldquo;Our thoughts and initiation of movements become faster &ndash; but because we are working faster, the external world appears to slow down,&rdquo; he says. It is even possible that some athletes have <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00209/full\">deliberately trained themselves to create a time warp on demand</a>: surfers, for instance, can often adjust their angle in the split second it takes to launch off steep waves, as the water rises overhead.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kdd1\"}}</p><p>For Baker, the experience was a one-off, and after surgery to remove the damaged blood vessels, he has now made a full recovery. He remains remarkably upbeat about his condition, pointing out that in some ways it has actually been of benefit. Beforehand, he had been somewhat taciturn, particularly around strangers &ndash; a tendency that had even been labelled a disability by his school. But today, his shyness has gone &ndash; a fact that is clearly evident as he chats happily during our telephone conversation. &ldquo;It was more than just feeling a little more forthcoming &ndash; I suddenly felt compelled to talk,&rdquo; he says. Ovsiew has verified the report with Baker&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;She confirmed that he was calmer, more talkative, and more friendly in social situations,&rdquo; says Ovsiew.</p><p>The experience of time freezing around him, meanwhile, has given him new wonder at the fragility of our conscious experiences. &ldquo;It was a really concrete example of how something very localised in brain can change your whole perception of the world,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;One minute I was fine, the next minute I was in an altered reality.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Have you ever experienced time slowing down or speeding up?

During dinner, they pick a foreign accent, and challenge each other to speak in the strange voice.</p><p>The playful jokes help to distract from the distress of a condition that her doctors have struggled to treat. Despite having lived in the UK her whole life, Matthias suddenly found that she no longer speaks with an English accent &ndash; sounding French or Chinese instead. &ldquo;Four years ago this Easter &ndash; that was the last time I heard my own voice,&rdquo; she tells me on the phone.</p><p>Matthias is one of a handful of people in the UK with foreign accent syndrome. Although their speech is completely fluent, their voices have somehow taken on odd characteristics that make them sound as if they grew up in another country.</p><p>The causes are complicated, and sometimes puzzling to scientists. Matthias thinks her experience can be pinned down to a car accident that was followed by blinding migraines, often accompanied by debilitating body pain. &ldquo;It feels like your brain is going to explode,&rdquo; says Matthias. &ldquo;Your joints are so tender, so painful, you feel you can&rsquo;t breathe, you can&rsquo;t get the air in&hellip; I&rsquo;d rather have more babies than go through that pain again.&rdquo;</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-sussex-27712021\"><strong>Hear Julie Matthias&rsquo;s accent in an interview with BBC News</strong></a></p><p>Then, a few months after these painful episodes started, something even stranger happened. Her voice started shifting accent. The change soon caught the attention of people in her beauty salon. &ldquo;Clients talked to me as if I didn&rsquo;t understand English.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02r8zc4\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s not clear exactly why the car accident caused that shift. Despite ongoing hospital visits, no neurologist has yet been able to pin down a definite cause of her migraines or her strange accent. It is especially hurtful, she says, when people assume the lack of diagnosis means her condition is imaginary, or they fail to see the impact of the disorder. &ldquo;People just take it as a joke condition. They focus on the fact that we speak with a [funny] accent.&rdquo;</p><p>It is no laughing matter. &ldquo;Think: you go to sleep, wake up and no longer sound to you like the person you really are &ndash;and there&rsquo;s nothing you can do about it,&rdquo; says Sheila Blumstein at Brown University, Rhode Island. &ldquo;That has a very profound effect on the patients.&rdquo; Fortunately, researchers like Blumstein are now coming to terms with both the causes and strange consequences of this puzzling disorder.</p><p>Initially, even the nature of the altered voice was a mystery. Were the people speaking with genuinely foreign accents &ndash; or were we being fooled by some other change? Blumstein&rsquo;s early work showed that the vowel sounds do indeed change a little, but more often it&rsquo;s down to differences in the underlying music of the voice. &ldquo;When we speak, we have a speech melody and rhythm &ndash; and it&rsquo;s here they have changes,&rdquo; says Blumstein.</p><p>The voice&rsquo;s intonation and stress &ndash; including the subtle ways we embellish a sentence and emphasise our point &ndash; is central to this. In 2012, Anja Kuschmann at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow found subtle differences in the way people with <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1460-6984.2012.00184.x/abstract\">foreign accent syndrome highlight different words</a>. &ldquo;They still use the same rising and falling tones as healthy speakers &ndash; but they use a lot more of them. Instead of highlighting some of the words, they highlighted all of them.&rdquo;</p><p>Intonation is one of the hardest aspects of an accent to master &ndash; many foreigners do indeed have abnormal voice rhythms compared to native speakers. Even so, the perception of the specific accent is somewhat subjective; some may think a subject with foreign accent syndrome sounds Russian; another, German. Indeed, what you hear in their voice probably depends on your own expectations. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a fiction created by the listener,&rdquo; says Johan Verhoeven at City University London.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02r8z34\"}}</p><p>As I speak to Matthias, it is easy to see why these mistakes happen. She pronounces &ldquo;accent&rdquo; with a heavier emphasis on the second syllable, for instance, that reminded me of my French teacher at school. But her staccato rhythm might sound a little like a Chinese accent too.</p><p>Often, those subtle signatures can be traced to known neurological damage. For instance, Barbara Tomasino, who is based at the University of Udine in Italy, recently examined a patient with a brain tumour. &ldquo;Sometimes she sounded like she was South American, sometimes she spoke with an English accent &ndash; it was a very strange way of speaking Italian,&rdquo; says Tomasino. The patient was awake while a surgeon operated on the tumour, allowing researchers to probe the electrical activity and function of the cells around the cancer. Although it sounds painful, this is a standard procedure that helps the surgeon work out where the tumour ends. Combined with information from fMRI scans, watching the neural activity in this way also allowed them to detect the cells involved in controlling the mouth and larynx&ndash; which turned out to be right next to the site of the tumour. By pressing on that region, the tumour may therefore have been disrupting her ability to plan the complex tongue and move movements needed to talk normally &ndash; leading to her strange accent.</p><p>The patient continued speaking throughout the operation, to be sure the surgeon didn&rsquo;t damage those vital areas surrounding the tumour. Although there was no immediate change in accent, as her brain recovered over the coming weeks, <a href=\"http://www.researchgate.net/publication/51842687_Foreign_accent_syndrome_A_multimodal_mapping_study\">the patient found that her old voice had returned</a>. &ldquo;The latest news we have is that she&rsquo;s OK and living normally,&rdquo; says Tomasino.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02r8ytn\"}}</p><p>Given that success, you might therefore expect all patients to show damage in that same part of the brain. Yet that&rsquo;s not the case. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve made great strides but we don&rsquo;t know the whole answer,&rdquo; says Blumstein. Perhaps a constellation of brain regions is involved, and if any one of them is damaged it can result in a different accent. One of Blumstein&rsquo;s patients developed a foreign accent after one stroke &ndash; and when a second stroke damaged a separate, seemingly unconnected region called the cerebellum (a small, cauliflower-shaped node at the base of the brain), she was cured and started speak like normal. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it had the effect &ndash; other than that the cerebellum is in an area involved in rhythm,&rdquo; says Blumstein.</p><p>In Matthias&rsquo;s case, doctors have been unable to pin it down the biological cause. In many other ways, however, her experiences resemble those of others with the disorder &ndash; including a sadly altered perception of herself. &ldquo;It takes away your whole identity &ndash; you lose what was you,&rdquo; says Matthias. At one point, she was even afraid of seeing her own reflection. &ldquo;It was hard to look in mirror and speak &ndash; because it wasn&rsquo;t my voice.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s not surprising, given the role the voice plays in forging our place in the world. &ldquo;The way we speak is a window onto our inner self,&rdquo; explains Nick Miller at Newcastle University. &ldquo;It marks social class, education level, whether you come from this place or that place &ndash; so consciously or subconsciously, we use accent to portray who we are and how we are.&rdquo;</p><p>Miller, along with Jack Ryalls of the University of Central Florida, recently compiled a book detailing these experiences, called <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Foreign-Accent-Syndromes-stories-people/dp/1848721536\">Foreign Accent Syndromes: The stories people have to tell</a>. The altered sense of self was familiar to many of the people who contributed their stories. &ldquo;I feel so lonely, isolated, scared. I feel like I have bereaved a good friend,&rdquo; wrote one contributor, Kath Lockett. Alone at home with her cocker spaniels, she had the eerie feeling that there was a &ldquo;stranger in the house&rdquo; whenever she spoke.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02r8ym4\"}}</p><p>Compounding the issues with their identity, these people also have to deal with surprising, and sometimes unkind, responses from those around them. Accents are also an important way for us to form boundaries between different social groups. Accordingly, some of the people in Miller&rsquo;s book report feeling marginalised &ndash; like &ldquo;a foreigner in my own country&rdquo;, he says. Matthias and Lockett have even experienced racism. &ldquo;I had a taxi driver try to charge me double fare for a journey I have taken before,&rdquo; wrote Lockett. &ldquo;Two bus drivers treated me like I was deaf, stupid and belittled me.&rdquo; Even friends can sometimes start to feel suspicious of their new vocal identity.</p><p>For Matthias, her own family have been the greatest comfort. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t do sympathy very well,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;My family know that, so they tend to take the mickey and ask me to say different words that I found difficult. We all sit around and laugh about it.&rdquo;</p><p>Like many others with the condition, she tries to keep a positive attitude. &ldquo;We try to look on the bright side, and things could be worse. My condition as we know it &ndash; and we don&rsquo;t know a lot &ndash; is not life threatening. That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to be thankful for,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;You just have to learn to cope &ndash; to keep fighting every day.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-05-13T08:49:36Z","HeadlineLong":"The mind-bending effects of foreign accent syndrome ","HeadlineShort":"‘I woke up sounding French’","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A little-known condition causes people to adopt a new accent – and lose a part of their identity in the process, finds David Robson.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"A little-known condition causes people to adopt a new accent – and lose a part of their identity in the process, finds David Robson.","SummaryShort":"The weird effects of foreign accent syndrome","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-13T08:49:36Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"d733be24-e482-49cf-81cd-55a5e68fb93b","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150513-the-weird-effects-of-foreign-accent-syndrome","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-13T08:49:36Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150513-the-weird-effects-of-foreign-accent-syndrome"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150513-the-weird-effects-of-foreign-accent-syndrome","_id":"55dc63b07f6bada044d0b19d"}],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"After simple dental surgery, William lost his ability to form new memories.

It was the beating of his &ldquo;second heart&rdquo;.</p><p>The small mechanical pump was meant to relieve the burden of his failing cardiac muscles, but Carlos (not his real name) disliked the sensation. The beat of the machine seemed to replace his pulse, a sensation that warped his body image: as the device throbbed above his navel, Carlos had the eerie feeling that his chest had dropped into the abdomen.</p><p>It was a strange, unsettling feeling. But when neuroscientist Agustin Ibanez met Carlos, he suspected even odder effects were to come. By changing the man&rsquo;s heart, Ibanez thought, the doctors might have also changed their patient&rsquo;s mind: Carlos would now think, feel and act differently as a result of the implant.</p><p>How come? We often talk about &ldquo;following the heart&rdquo;, but it is only recently that scientists have begun to show that there is literal truth in the cliche; the heaving lump of muscle contributes to our emotions and the mysterious feelings of &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; in a very real way. Everything from your empathy for another person&rsquo;s pain to the hunch that your spouse is having an affair may originate from subtle signals in your heart and the rest of your body.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23887813\">the man who feels two hearts</a> offered Ibanez, who is based at Favaloro University in Buenos Aires, a unique opportunity to test those ideas.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Cranial stuffing&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ibanez&rsquo;s work chimes with millennia of speculation about the heart&rsquo;s role in cognition &ndash; which was sometimes thought to supersede the brain&rsquo;s. Touching the cool, moist grey matter of the cortex, for instance, <a href=\"http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/jspui/bitstream/1880/47541/1/Reynolds_2007.pdf\">Aristotle assumed that the brain&rsquo;s main function was to chill the passions erupting from the heart</a> &ndash; which he considered the seat of the soul. For similar reasons, embalmers in ancient Egyptians made sure to leave the heart in the chest, but happily removed the mere &ldquo;cranial stuffing&rdquo; from the head.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhfl\"}}</p><p>We now take a more cerebral view of thought, even if the view of the heart as the font of our emotions has lingered; just consider the many metaphors we use to describe feelings today. William James, the founder of modern psychology, helped formalise these ideas in the 19th Century by suggesting that emotions are really a back-and-forth feedback cycle between the body and the brain. According to his theory, the brain might be able to register a threat intellectually &ndash; but it is our awareness of the racing heartbeat and sweaty palms that transforms an abstract concept into a visceral emotion.</p><p>James&rsquo; ideas also raised an important question: if everybody has different bodily awareness, would that shape the emotions they experience? The idea was difficult to test, however, but a hundred years later scientists are now on the case.</p><p>The studies first asked subjects to count their heartbeats based solely on the feelings within their chest; they weren&rsquo;t allowed to put their hand on their heart or actively take their pulse. Try it for yourself, and you&rsquo;ll see that this kind of &ldquo;interoception&rdquo; can be surprisingly difficult; around one in four people miss the mark by about 50%, suggesting they have little to no perception of the movements inside them; only a quarter get 80% accuracy. After testing their cardiac awareness, the researchers then gave the volunteers various cognitive tests.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhqz\"}}</p><p>James, it turned out, was spot on. People with more bodily awareness tend have <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16729289\">more intense reactions to emotive pictures</a> and report being more greatly moved by them; they are also better at describing their feelings. Importantly, this sensitivity seems to extend to others&rsquo; feelings &ndash; they <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559130\">are better at recognising emotions in others&rsquo; faces</a> &ndash; and they are also quicker to learn to avoid a threat, such as a small electric shock in the lab, perhaps because those more intense bodily feelings saturate their memories, making the aversion more visceral. &ldquo;It may quickly clue us in to the relative goodness or badness of the objects, choices, or avenues of action that we are facing,&rdquo; says Daniella Furman at the University of California, Berkeley. In other words, people who are in tune with their bodies have a richer, more vivid emotional life &ndash; including both the ups and downs of life. &ldquo;We may not be able to describe the particular physiological signature of a pleasurable experience, but we would probably recognise the sensations when they occur,&rdquo; she says.</p><p><strong>Emotional barometer</strong></p><p>These <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106893\">secret bodily signals may also lie behind our intuition</a> &ndash; the indefinable hunches that you have the winning hand in poker, say, according to an elegant study by Barney Dunn at the University of Exeter. The task was simple: the volunteers were asked to choose cards from four decks, and they would win money if it matched the colour of another, upturned card.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhbg\"}}</p><p>The game was rigged so that you were slightly more likely to win from two of the decks, and lose if you picked from the other two. Dunn found that the people who could track their heartbeat with the most accuracy would tend to pick from certain decks, whereas those with poor interoception were more likely to choose at random.&nbsp;</p><p>The bodily-aware people weren&rsquo;t always correct &ndash; they were the worst losers as well as the best winners &ndash; but the point was that they were more likely to follow their hunches.</p><p>So the folklore may be right: people who are in touch with their heart are more likely to be swayed by their instincts &ndash; for good or bad. All of which prompted Ibanez to wonder what would happen when you are fitted with an artificial heart? If Carlos experienced substantial changes, it would offer important new evidence that our mind extends well beyond the brain.</p><p>And that is exactly what he found. When Carlos tapped out his pulse, for instance, he followed the machine&rsquo;s rhythms rather than his own heartbeat. The fact that this also changed other perceptions of his body &ndash; seeming to expand the size of his chest, for instance &ndash; is perhaps to be expected; in some ways, changing the position of the heart was creating a sensation not unlike the famous &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/visualized-heartbeat-out-of-body-experience/28728/\">rubber hand illusion</a>&rdquo;. But crucially, it also seemed to have markedly altered certain social and emotional skills. Carlos seemed to lack empathy when he viewed pictures of people having a painful accident, for instance. He also had more general problems with his ability to read other&rsquo;s motives, and, crucially, intuitive decision making &ndash; all of which is in line with the idea that the body rules emotional cognition. &ldquo;It is a very interesting, very intriguing study,&rdquo; says Dunn of the findings.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A lifeless shell&rdquo;</p><p></strong></p><p>Sadly, Carlos died from complications during later treatments &ndash; but Ibanez now hopes to continue his studies with other patients. He is currently performing tests on people undergoing a full heart transplant to see how it could influence interoception. Damage to the vagal nerve should cut off some of the internal signals sent from the heart to the brain, which might then impact their cognition.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhd7\"}}</p><p>Away from the cardiac clinic, he is also looking at whether a fault in the link between body and brain could lead to strange depersonalisation disorders, in which patients have the eerie feeling that they don&rsquo;t inhabit their own body. &ldquo;I feel as though I'm not alive, as though my body is an empty, lifeless shell,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1025389031000138538\">one patient told researchers</a>. &ldquo;I seem to be walking in a world I recognise but don't feel.&rdquo; Ibanez has found that they tend to show worse interoception, and brain scans suggest that this results from a breakdown in communication across the anterior insula &ndash; a deep fold of the cortex that is, tellingly, implicated in <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098769\">body awareness, emotion perception, empathy, decision making &ndash; and the sense of self</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Dunn, who is a clinical psychologist, is more concerned about its relevance to depression. &ldquo;At the moment therapy is very much in the head &ndash; we change what the client thinks and trust that their emotions will follow up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I often hit a wall: they say that they know these things intellectually, but emotionally they can&rsquo;t feel it.&rdquo;</p><p>Even after therapy has trained more positive thinking, the patient may still struggle to feel joy, for example &ndash; a problem that Dunn suspects may come from poor interoception. He gives the example that when you are walking around the park, your body might give you all sorts of pleasant feedback that shows you are relaxed and peaceful. &ldquo;But depressed clients seem to walk around the park without being engaged with the sensory experience,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and then they come back and say it was flat and empty&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkj1d\"}}</p><p>Along these lines, Furman has found that people with major depressive disorder (but without other complications like anxiety) struggle to feel their own heart beat; and the poorer their awareness, the less likely they were to report positive experiences in their daily life. And as Dunn&rsquo;s work on decision making would have suggested, poor body perception also seemed to be linked to measures of indecision &ndash; a problem that blights many people with depression. Furman stresses, however, that there may be many different kinds of depression, and poor bodily awareness may only influence some of them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not clear why some people may have reduced bodily awareness, but Dunn thinks it can be trained, with practice. He is currently looking into the use of mindfulness-based therapy, which encourages people to focus on the sensations in their body. He says the challenge is to try to recognise the feelings, even if they are unpleasant, without reacting to them in a knee-jerk way. You should then be better equipped to use the body as the &ldquo;emotional barometer&rdquo; to inform you about your state of mind and decide how to act. Another group has <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038304\">designed a rudimentary computer game</a> that asks you to tap a key with every four heartbeats, and flashes red when you are wrong, offering feedback that should boost body awareness.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? You can enjoy a richer, more emotional life; tune into the sensory pleasures of the world, and make better decisions. And all you have to do is listen to your heart.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20141205-the-man-with-two-hearts&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2d%2Fkh%2Fp02dkh7c.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\"><em>Share this story on Facebook</em></a><em>, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Take a deep dive into the big stories in science, technology and health written by some of the best writers around.","Name":"In Depth","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"In Depth","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/in-depth","_id":"55dc627e7f6bada044cfc35f"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Health","Name":"Health","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Health"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:44:06.503434Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"00a9a33a-e393-4d09-8029-7e9d5bd1d8cb","Id":"wwfuture/section/health","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:52:37.074442Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/health"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/health","_id":"55dc627b7f6bada044cfc087"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Science & Environment","Name":"Science & Environment","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Science & Environment"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:51:45.984509Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"1aa4ccec-87b5-44b8-b5af-c553debaf6f6","Id":"wwfuture/section/science-environment","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:51:20.083392Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/science-environment"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/science-environment","_id":"55dc627b7f6bada044cfc098"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Technology","Name":"Technology","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Technology"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T11:42:22.339015Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"fadfa439-a201-46b6-a8fd-d8813cac4bbf","Id":"wwfuture/section/technology","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:49:02.740858Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/technology"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/technology","_id":"55dc627b7f6bada044cfc0ad"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-05T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The mind-bending effects of feeling two hearts ","HeadlineShort":"The man with two hearts","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"When a man was fitted with a new heart, his mind changed in unusual ways.

There&rsquo;s a fair chance that you&rsquo;d be doing it wrong.</p><p>One of the interesting things about the mind is that even though we all have one, we don't have perfect insight into how to get the best from it. This is in part because of flaws in our ability to think about our own thinking, which is called metacognition. Studying this self-reflective thought process reveals that the human species has mental blind spots.</p><p>One area where these blind spots are particularly large is learning. We're actually surprisingly bad at having insight into <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140917-the-worst-way-to-learn\">how we learn best</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8mrj\"}}</p><p>Researchers Jeffrey Karpicke and Henry Roediger III set out to look at one aspect: how <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5865/966.abstract\">testing can consolidate our memory</a> of facts. In their experiment they asked college students to learn pairs of Swahili and English words. So, for example, they had to learn that if they were given the Swahili word 'mashua' the correct response was 'boat'. They could have used the sort of facts you might get on a high-school quiz (e.g. \"Who wrote the first computer programs?\"/\"Ada Lovelace\"), but the use of Swahili meant that there was little chance their participants could use any background knowledge to help them learn. After the pairs had all been learnt, there would be a final test a week later.</p><p>Now if many of us were revising this list we might study the list, test ourselves and then repeat this cycle, dropping items we got right. This makes studying (and testing) quicker and allows us to focus our effort on the things we haven't yet learnt. It&rsquo;s a plan that seems to make perfect sense, but it&rsquo;s a plan that is disastrous if we really want to learn properly.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8mss\"}}</p><p>Karpicke and Roediger asked students to prepare for a test in various ways, and compared their success &ndash; for example, one group kept testing themselves on all items without dropping what they were getting right, while another group stopped testing themselves on their correct answers.</p><p>On the final exam differences between the groups were dramatic. While dropping items from study didn&rsquo;t have much of an effect, the people who dropped items from <em>testing</em> performed relatively poorly: they could only remember about 35% of the word pairs, compared to 80% for people who kept testing items after they had learnt them.</p><p>It seems the effective way to learn is to practice retrieving items from memory, not trying to cement them in there by further study. Moreover, dropping items entirely from your revision, which is the advice given by many study guides, is wrong. You can stop studying them if you've learnt them, but you should keep testing what you've learnt if you want to remember them at the time of the final exam.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8msf\"}}</p><p>Finally, the researchers had the neat idea of asking their participants how well they would remember what they had learnt. All groups guessed at about 50%. This was a large overestimate for those who dropped items from test (and an underestimate from those who kept testing learnt items).&nbsp;</p><p>So it seems that we have a metacognitive blind spot for which revision strategies will work best. Making this a situation where we need to be guided by the evidence, and not our instinct.

But although what follows can seem like a short dream &ndash; perhaps a single conversation or a short walk &ndash; I&rsquo;ll sometimes awake to find that a whole hour has passed. And I&rsquo;m left puzzling: how could such few events have taken so long to play out in my head? Is this a common effect?</p><p>Now researchers may have hit upon a way to answer this question, by studying those who can take control of their sleeping brains &ndash; so called &ldquo;lucid dreamers&rdquo;. Probing the experience of these people is also revealing other bizarre effects, too, such as whether it&rsquo;s possible to tickle yourself in your sleep.</p><p>Lucid dreaming has offered insights into the sleeping mind for more than 100 years. One of the earliest dream researchers was a 19th Century French aristocrat, the Marquis d&rsquo;Hervey de Saint-Denys, who found he could direct the path of his dreams at the age of 13 and spent the next few decades using his lucid dreams to test the limits of his sleeping mind.</p><p><strong>Strange trips</strong></p><p>His escapades involved, among other things, <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029480.700-sleeping-daredevil-the-first-dream-hacker.html?full=true#.VHMJBRD2fEc\">throwing his dream-self from the tops of tall buildings</a> to see whether he could dream his own death. Invariably, he couldn&rsquo;t and the dream changed scene, avoiding a grisly end. &nbsp;And by noticing the way that places and people from his travels often populated his visions, he concluded that dreams are formed from a patchwork of our memories, offering a more rational explanation than the prevailing spiritualist theories of the time. Another pioneer was the author EM Forster&rsquo;s niece, Mary Arnold-Forster, who wrote a <a href=\"https://archive.org/details/studiesindreams00arnogoog\">guidebook to lucid dreaming</a> in the 1920s; she used her dream awareness to avoid frightening nightmares about World War I.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02crdst\"}}</p><p>Arnold-Forster and Saint-Denys&rsquo;s work was mostly ignored, however, and during the following decades lucid dreams were over-looked for more &ldquo;serious&rdquo; lines of enquiry. But in recent years neuroscientists have recently started embarking on some equally eccentric experiments. Earlier this year, for instance, Jennifer Windt at the Johannes Gutenberg-University of Mainz in Germany decided to find out if lucid dreamers could tickle themselves in a dream. That might sound whimsical, but it helps to test the level of self-awareness in dreams. In real life, we can&rsquo;t tickle ourselves because we know that what we&rsquo;re doing, meaning that the brain damps down the sensations that would normally cause us to break down in giggles. Importantly, the same was true in lucid dreams; <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00717/full\">the subjects found it difficult to make themselves laugh</a>, which suggests their dream self has a high degree of awareness of their bodily actions and sensations, and minimises the response.</p><p>Interestingly, Windt also asked the subjects to ask other characters in the dream to tickle them. &ldquo;Several times, dream characters just refused,&rdquo; says Windt. &ldquo;They behaved as if they had a mind and intentions of their own.&rdquo; When the other being did tickle the dreamer, however, the effect was often underwhelming &ndash; which suggests the brain still recognised its control over those other dream characters. <strong></p><p>Sleep-walking</p><p></strong>Studying the passage of time in dreams had proven trickier to study, however, until Daniel Erlacher at the University of Bern in Switzerland set up an ingenious experiment.</p><p>It began when he was investigating the way the brain imagines different actions; when we dream of running, do we activate the same regions that are busy during a race, for instance? His early experiments suggested yes, but somehow they seemed to be strangely drawn out.</p><p>So, inviting some skilled lucid dreamers to his specially equipped sleep lab, he asked his subjects to perform various kinds of tasks during their dreams: once they had gained lucidity, they had to walk 10 paces, count to 30 or perform an elaborate gymnastics routine, for instance. To time the duration of their actions, he used a peculiar aspect of the dreaming mind: although the body is paralysed, eye movements tend to be translated to the body. In this way, the subjects could signal the start and end of the actions by rolling their eyes left and right a couple of times. Along the way, Erlacher measured their brain activity and muscle movements, to be sure they weren&rsquo;t just pretending to be asleep.</p><p>As he expected, the dreamers sometimes took up to 50% longer to complete the routines than you would in real life, suggesting that they were somehow playing out their tasks in slow motion, even though they didn&rsquo;t realise it at the time. &ldquo;They reported that it felt exactly the same as in wakefulness,&rdquo; says Erlacher.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02crf0j\"}}</p><p>Perhaps that can explain why a short dream can seem to fill the whole hour. Even so, Erlacher is currently at a loss to explain the phenomenon; brain activity during sleep may just take longer to process information, he suggests.</p><p>There is, however, a practical (if somewhat fantastical) side to Erlacher&rsquo;s work; he hopes that athletes could use lucid dreaming to cram in a bit of extra practice. Sleep is, after all, crucial for memory consolidation &ndash; so it&rsquo;s feasible that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140721-how-to-learn-while-you-sleep\">dream practice could cement new skills</a>. That could be useful to allow an athlete to sharpen their skills when they can&rsquo;t otherwise train &ndash; after an injury, for example. &ldquo;Of course, there are limits &ndash; you can&rsquo;t improve endurance, but if you have good simulator in brain already, can use it to enhance and stabilise the techniques. I see it as a lot of potential for disciplines with a high technical level.&rdquo; His interviews with top athletes suggest that many are already using the technique, he says, and he is currently investigating the benefits.</p><p>His team&rsquo;s experiments have included standard laboratory learning tasks &ndash; like mastering sequences of finger movements &ndash; alongside more conventional sports, like darts. &ldquo;It seems to be very effective &ndash; it&rsquo;s a bit worse than real practice but better than [conscious] mental rehearsal,&rdquo; he says of his results so far. The time distortion during dreams shouldn&rsquo;t be a problem, he thinks, since overall the sequences of events seems to be preserved, even if they do take longer to perform.</p><p>Admittedly, using our sleep for self-improvement may only appeal to the more puritanical or ambitious among us. But at the very least, learning to master lucid dreams could offer me a new excuse to avoid the plunge out of bed in the morning.</p><p><em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20141125-do-dreams-occur-in-slow-motion&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2c%2Frd%2Fp02crdkn.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\">Share this article on Facebook</a>, </em><em>or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a>.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-25T00:00:00Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"Do dreams occur in slow motion?","HeadlineShort":"Do we dream in slow motion?","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"When we dream, does time pass at a different pace?

These myths crop up every now and then (look at the premise of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_%282014_film%29\">Lucy movie</a> this summer), but they are quickly shot down by those in the know.</p><p>In contrast to these enduring stories, other misconceptions are stealthier and slip beneath the radar unrecognised. One of these is the idea that the human brain is served by five senses. This belief is so ingrained that even the scientifically literate will treat it as taken-for-granted common knowledge.</p><p>Perhaps it is due to the idea&rsquo;s noble origins. The principle of five basic human senses is often traced back to Aristotle&rsquo;s De Anima (On the Soul), in which he devotes a separate chapter to vision, hearing, touch, smell and taste. Today, the five senses are considered such an elementary truth that it is sometimes used as a point of consensus before writers embark on more mysterious or contentious topics. &ldquo;What do we actually mean by reality?&rdquo; asked the author of <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528840.500-reality-the-definition.html\">a recent article</a> in New Scientist magazine. &ldquo;A straightforward answer is that it means everything that appears to our five senses.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Incoming information</strong></p><p>If only it were that simple. Simply defining what we mean by a &ldquo;sense&rdquo; leads you down a slippery slope into philosophy. One, somewhat vague, definition might argue that a human sense is simply a unique way for the brain to receive information about the world and the body. If that is the case, then we can claim with confidence that there are certainly more than five human senses.</p><p>First consider the senses that relate to the position of our bodies. Close your eyes, and then touch your right forefinger to your left elbow tip. Easy? How did you do it? Somehow you knew where the end of your finger was and you also knew the position of your left elbow. This sense is known as proprioception and it&rsquo;s the awareness we have of where each of our body parts is located in space. Proprioception is possible thanks to receptors in our muscles known as spindles, which tell the brain about the current length and stretch of the muscles.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02c7y6n\"}}</p><p>Now imagine you are blindfolded and I tilted you forwards slowly. You&rsquo;d immediately have a sensation of how your body&rsquo;s position was changing in relation to gravity. This is thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141007-why-astronauts-get-space-stupid\">fluid-filled vestibular system</a> in your inner ear, which helps us keep balance. This system also gives us our experience of acceleration through space, and it links up with the eyes, making it possible to cancel out our own motion. If you wiggle your head around while reading, for example, you&rsquo;ll see that it makes little difference to your ability to read and stay focused on the words.</p><p>There are also numerous senses providing us with information about the inner state of our bodies. The most obvious of these are hunger and thirst, inner body pain, and the need to empty the bladder or bowel. Less obvious and less available to conscious awareness are incoming signals about blood pressure, the pH level of the cerebrospinal fluid, plus many more.</p><p>Some might take that definition further, to argue that the senses should be defined by the types of receptors we have; a different sensor means a different sense. If that were the case, then even well-known senses quickly split into different varieties. For instance, if you closed your eyes and I surprised you with an ice cube down your back, you&rsquo;d experience a shock of cold. This sensation would be distinct from the mere touch of a plastic cube, say. Alongside temperature-sensitive receptors, packed in our skin we also have receptors dedicated to mechanical pressure, pain (known as nociceptors) and itch (pruritic receptors). Using the same logic, however, taste can be divided into sweet, sour, salty and bitter and potentially &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29912877\">umami</a>&rdquo;, which is activated by monosodium glutamate and is associated with a &ldquo;meaty&rdquo; flavour. Splitting the senses in this way doesn&rsquo;t feel like the most intuitive way of dealing with the question, however, and it becomes even more absurd if we turn to smell: humans have over 1,000 distinct olfactory receptors tuned to different odorous molecules. Should each one be counted as a different sense?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02c7xwg\"}}</p><p>At the other extreme, you could restrict our definition of discrete sense to the physical categories of incoming information. We can simplify the human senses down to just three &ndash; mechanical (which takes in touch, hearing and proprioception); chemical (including taste, smell and internal senses); and light.</p><p>Yet another way of approaching this issue is to think not about the category of incoming information or the perceptual experience, but about how incoming sensory information is used. A great example is the human capacity for echo-location. Human echo-location works by a person emitting a clicking sound with the tongue and listening for how it rebounds off the immediate environment. In the USA there is even a remarkable team of blind cyclists &ndash; Team Bat &ndash; led by Daniel Kisch, who use echo-location to go mountain biking (see <a href=\"http://www.worldaccessfortheblind.org\">www.worldaccessfortheblind.org</a> for videos). This ability depends on the traditional sense of hearing, but the perceptual experience and function is more akin to vision. You don&rsquo;t need to be blind to try it; even sighted people can learn to &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/39231-humans-can-learn-to-echolocate.html\">see in the dark</a>&rdquo; using echo-location. For these reasons, some consider it a separate sense.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{\"id\":\"Human-echolocation-Daniel-Kish\"}}</p><p>As you can see, there is no single, logical way to define the senses. In some ways, it might make little sense to draw divisions between them at all &ndash; considering that they often seem to blend together; the colour of food &ndash; and even the sounds of a restaurant &ndash; can influence taste, for instance. Understanding these relationships is important when studying conditions like synaesthesia and could even shed light on consciousness itself.</p><p>But whichever way you look at it, five is a pretty arbitrary and meaningless number &ndash; a glaring &ldquo;myth&rdquo; of the brain that needs further recognition. Indeed, once you start thinking about all the different kinds of information reaching the human brain, you might even find that you develop a brand new sense &ndash; a radar-like sensitivity to some of the other misconceptions regarding the way the brain experiences the world. You might have once called it a &ldquo;sixth sense&rdquo; &ndash; but you know better now, don&rsquo;t you?</p><p>This article is based on a chapter from Christian Jarrett&rsquo;s new book <a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118312716,descCd-buy.html\">Great Myths of the Brain</a> (Wiley).</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\">Google+</a> page, or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-19T12:31:54Z","HeadlineLong":"Psychology: How many senses do we have?","HeadlineShort":"Do humans have secret senses?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often talk of having five senses as a universal truth.

Simon Baker entered the bathroom to see if a warm shower could ease his pain. &ldquo;I looked up at the shower head, and it was as if the water droplets had stopped in mid-air&rdquo;, he says. &ldquo;They came into hard focus rapidly, over the course of a few seconds&rdquo;. Where you&rsquo;d normally perceive the streams as more of a blur of movement, he could see each one hanging in front of him, distorted by the pressure of the air rushing past. The effect, he recalls, was very similar to the way the bullets travelled in the Matrix movies. &ldquo;It was like a high-speed film, slowed down.&rdquo;</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140626-your-amazing-time-warp-stories\">See readers' stories of how they experienced time standing still</a></li></ul><p>The next day, Baker went to hospital, where doctors found that he had suffered an aneurysm. The experience was soon overshadowed by the more immediate threat to his health, but in a follow-up appointment, he happened to mention what happened to his neurologist, Fred Ovsiew at Northwestern University in Chicago, who was struck by the vivid descriptions. &ldquo;He was a very bright guy, and very eloquent&rdquo; says Ovsiew, who recently wrote about Baker in the journal <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23557277\">NeuroCase</a>. (Baker&rsquo;s identity was anonymised, which is typical for such studies, so this is not his real name).</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kc63\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to assume that time flows at the same rate for everybody, but experiences like Baker&rsquo;s show that our continuous stream of consciousness is a fragile illusion, stitched together by the brain&rsquo;s clever editing. By studying what happens during such extreme events, researchers are revealing how and why the brain plays these temporal tricks &ndash; and in some circumstances, they suggest, all of us can experience time warping.</p><p>Although Baker is perhaps the most dramatic case, a smattering of strikingly similar accounts can be found, intermittently, in medical literature. There are reports of time speeding up &ndash; so called &ldquo;zeitraffer&rdquo; phenomenon &ndash; and also more fragmentary experiences called &ldquo;akinetopsia&rdquo;, in which motion momentarily stops. For instance, travelling home one day, one 61-year-old woman reported that the <a href=\"http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/61428/1/61428.pdf\">movement of the closing train doors, and fellow passengers, was in slow motion and &ldquo;broken up&rdquo;, as if in &ldquo;freeze frames&rdquo;</a>. A 58-year-old Japanese man, meanwhile, seemed to be experiencing life like a badly dubbed movie; in conversation, he found that although <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213323213000236\">others&rsquo; voices sounded normal, they were out of sync with their faces</a>. There may be many more unreported cases, says Ovsiew. &ldquo;Since it&rsquo;s a transient phenomenon, it could often be overlooked.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kc87\"}}</p><p>Such experiences almost always accompany problems like epilepsy or stroke. Baker was only 39 at the time of his experience, which seems to have been caused by a weakened blood vessel that began bleeding while he was carrying some heavy boxes. The result was a relatively large patch of neural damage in the right hemisphere. &ldquo;In the scans, it looks like there&rsquo;s a cigar in my head,&rdquo; he jokes today.</p><p>Yet why did this affect Baker&rsquo;s time perception? Some clues could come from studies that have attempted to pinpoint the regions responsible for our perception of time. Of particular interest is an area of the visual cortex, called V5. This region, which lies towards the back of the skull, has long been known to detect the motion of objects, but perhaps it has a more general role in measuring the passing of time. When Domenica Bueti and colleagues at the University Hospital of Lausanne, Switzerland zapped the area with a magnetic field to knock out its activity, her subjects found it tricky to do two things: they struggled to track the motion of dots on a screen, as would be expected, &nbsp;but also found it <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/30/12423\">hard to estimate how long some blue dots appeared too. </a></p><p>One explanation for this double-failure is that our motion perception system has its own stopwatch, recording how fast things are moving across our vision &ndash; and when this is disrupted by brain injury, the world stands still. For Baker, stepping into the shower might have exacerbated the problem, since the warm water would have drawn the blood away from the brain to the extremities of the body, further disturbing the brain&rsquo;s processing.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kcng\"}}</p><p>It is just one possibility; not all patients with time warping experiences have damage to V5, so other cogs in the brain&rsquo;s time-keeping apparatus may also play a role.</p><p>Another explanation comes from the discovery that our brain records its perceptions in discrete &ldquo;snapshots&rdquo;, like the frames of a film reel. &ldquo;The healthy brain reconstructs the experience and glues together the different frames,&rdquo; says <a href=\"http://cerco.ups-tlse.fr/~rufin/index_files/contact.htm\">Rufin VanRullen at the French Centre for Brain and Cognition Research</a> in Toulouse, &ldquo;but if brain damage destroys the glue, you might only see the snapshots.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kcs2\"}}</p><p>We may all experience the normal smooth picture breaking down occasionally. For starters, if you&rsquo;ve ever looked at overtaking cars on the motorway, their <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0002911\">wheels can seem to stand still</a>. This happens because the brain&rsquo;s intermittent snapshots fail to capture the wheel&rsquo;s motion fully. If, for example, it has made a full rotation between each &ldquo;frame&rdquo;, it will seem to be in exactly the same position each snapshot, giving the illusion that it is stationary.</p><p>And users of LSD often report &ldquo;visual trails&rdquo; following moving objects, a bit like the trails of bullets in The Matrix movie. VanRullen suspects this might arise because the <a href=\"http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001056\">brain somehow overlaps those sensory snapshots</a>, rather than refreshing its picture anew.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kd2n\"}}</p><p>Reports of time standing still are also common during a life-threatening accident; in one survey of people who had skirted close to death, more than 70% reported the feeling that the event occurred in slow motion. Some researchers claim that they are simply an artefact of memory, since the <a href=\"http://edge.org/conversation/brain-time\">intense emotions lead us to lay down more details</a>, so that we believe that the event lasted for longer only in hindsight. But the descriptions certainly sound close to those reported by the neurological patients, suggesting there may be some overlap.</p><p>For example, one person told researchers in the 1970s how they <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0010440X77900104\">vividly remembered seeing the face of a train&rsquo;s engineer during a near fatal collision</a>: &ldquo;It was like a movie run slowly so the frames progress with a jerky motion &ndash; that was how I saw the face&rdquo;.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, Valtteri Arstila at University of Turku, Finland, points out that many of these subjects also report abnormally quick thinking. As one pilot, who&rsquo;d faced a plane crash in the Vietnam War, put it: &ldquo;when the nose-wheel strut collapsed I vividly recalled, in a matter of about three seconds, over a dozen actions necessary to successful recovery of flight attitude&rdquo;. Reviewing the case studies and available scientific research on the matter, Arstila concludes that <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00196/full\">an automatic mechanism, triggered by stress hormones, might speed up the brain&rsquo;s internal processing to help it handle the life or death situation</a>. &ldquo;Our thoughts and initiation of movements become faster &ndash; but because we are working faster, the external world appears to slow down,&rdquo; he says. It is even possible that some athletes have <a href=\"http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00209/full\">deliberately trained themselves to create a time warp on demand</a>: surfers, for instance, can often adjust their angle in the split second it takes to launch off steep waves, as the water rises overhead.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021kdd1\"}}</p><p>For Baker, the experience was a one-off, and after surgery to remove the damaged blood vessels, he has now made a full recovery. He remains remarkably upbeat about his condition, pointing out that in some ways it has actually been of benefit. Beforehand, he had been somewhat taciturn, particularly around strangers &ndash; a tendency that had even been labelled a disability by his school. But today, his shyness has gone &ndash; a fact that is clearly evident as he chats happily during our telephone conversation. &ldquo;It was more than just feeling a little more forthcoming &ndash; I suddenly felt compelled to talk,&rdquo; he says. Ovsiew has verified the report with Baker&rsquo;s wife. &ldquo;She confirmed that he was calmer, more talkative, and more friendly in social situations,&rdquo; says Ovsiew.</p><p>The experience of time freezing around him, meanwhile, has given him new wonder at the fragility of our conscious experiences. &ldquo;It was a really concrete example of how something very localised in brain can change your whole perception of the world,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;One minute I was fine, the next minute I was in an altered reality.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Have you ever experienced time slowing down or speeding up?

Ask Abby Ross, a retired psychologist from Miami, Florida, a &ldquo;short-sleeper&rdquo;. She needs only four hours sleep a night, so has a lot of spare time to fill while the rest of the world is in the land of nod.</p><p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s wonderful to have so many hours in my day &ndash; I feel like I can live two lives,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>Short-sleepers like Ross never feel lethargic, nor do they ever sleep in. They wake early <em>&ndash;</em> normally around four or five o&rsquo;clock <em>&ndash;</em> raring to get on with their day. Margaret Thatcher may have been one &ndash; she famously said she needed just four hours a night, whereas Mariah Carey claims she needs 15.</p><p>What makes some people fantastically efficient sleepers, while others spend half their day snoozing? And can we change our sleeping pattern to make it more efficient?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wfjhq\"}}</p><p>In 2009, a woman came into&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.neuroscience.ucsf.edu/neurograd/faculty/fu.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ying-Hui Fu&rsquo;s lab</a>&nbsp;at the University of California, San Francisco, complaining that she always woke up too early. At first, Fu thought the woman was an extreme morning lark <em>&ndash;</em> a person who goes to bed early and wakes early. However, the woman explained that she actually went to bed around midnight and woke at 4am feeling completely alert. It was the same for several members of her family, she said.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> She went to bed around midnight and woke at 4am feeling completely alert </p></blockquote><p>Fu and her colleagues compared the genome of different family members. They <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2884988/\">discovered a tiny mutation in a gene called DEC2</a> that was present in those who were short-sleepers, but not in members of the family who had normal length sleep, nor in 250 unrelated volunteers.</p><p>When the team bred mice to express this same mutation, the rodents also slept less but performed just as well as regular mice when given physical and cognitive tasks.</p><p>Getting too little sleep normally has a significant impact on health, quality of life and life expectancy. It can cause depression, weight gain and put you at greater risk of stroke and diabetes.&nbsp;&ldquo;Sleep is so important, if you sleep well you can avoid many diseases, even dementia,&rdquo; says Fu.&nbsp;&ldquo;If you deprive someone of just two hours sleep a day, their cognitive functions become significantly&nbsp;impaired almost immediately.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> Why sleep is so important is still a bit of a mystery </p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;<br /> But why sleep is so important is still a bit of a mystery.&nbsp;The general consensus is that the brain needs sleep to do some housekeeping and general maintenance, since it doesn&rsquo;t get much downtime during the day. While we sleep, the brain can repair cellular damage, remove toxins that accumulate during the day, boost flagging energy supplies and lay down memories.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wfjnn\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;Clearly people with the DEC2 mutation can do the same cleaning up process in a shorter period of time &ndash; they are just more efficient than the rest of us at sleeping,&rdquo; says Fu. &ldquo;But how are they doing that? That&rsquo;s the key question.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Since discovering the DEC2 mutation, a lot of people have come forward claiming to only sleep a few hours a day, says Fu. Most of these had insomnia, she says. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not focusing on those people who have sleeping issues that make them sleep less, we wanted to focus on people who sleep for a few hours and feel great.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> I always feel great when I wake up - Abby Ross </p></blockquote><p>A positive outlook is common among all of the short-sleepers that Fu has studied. &ldquo;Anecdotally,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;they are all very energetic, very optimistic. It&rsquo;s very common for them to feel like they want to cram as much into life as they can, but we&rsquo;re not sure how or whether this is related to their mutations.&rdquo;</p><p>Ross would seem to fit that mould. &ldquo;I always feel great when I wake up,&rdquo; she says. She has been living on four to five hours sleep every day for as long as she can remember.</p><p>&ldquo;Those hours in the morning &ndash; around five o&rsquo;clock &ndash; are just fabulous. It&rsquo;s so peaceful and quiet and you can get so much done. I wish more shops were open at that time, but I can shop online, or I can read &ndash; oh there&rsquo;s so much to read in this world! Or I can go out and exercise before anyone else is up, or talk to people in other time zones.&rdquo;</p><p>Her short sleeping patterns allowed her to complete university in two and a half years, as well as affording her time to learn lots of new skills. For example, just three weeks after giving birth to her first son, Ross decided to use one of her early mornings to attempt to run around the block. It took her 10 minutes. The following day she did it again, running a little further. She slowly increased the time she ran, finally completing not one, but 37 marathons &ndash; one a month over three years &ndash; plus several ultramarathons. &ldquo;I can get up and do my exercise before anyone else is up and then it&rsquo;s done, out of the way,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wfjkr\"}}</p><p>As a child, Ross remembers spending very early mornings with her dad, another short-sleeper. &ldquo;Our early mornings gave us such a special time together,&rdquo; she says. Now, if she ever oversleeps &ndash; which she says has only ever happened a handful of times, her husband thinks she&rsquo;s dead. &ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t lay in, I&rsquo;d feel terrible if I did,&rdquo; she says.</p><p><strong>Take a shortcut</strong></p><p>Fu has subsequently sequenced the genomes of several other families who fit the criteria of short-sleepers. They&rsquo;re only just beginning to understand the gene mutations that lead to this talent, but in principle, she says, it might one day be possible to enable short sleeping in others.</p><blockquote><p> The most effective way to improve your sleep is to fix your wake-up time in the morning </p></blockquote><p>Until then, are there any shortcuts to a more efficient night&rsquo;s sleep for the rest of us?&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thesleepconsultancy.com/index_files/WhoamI.htm\">Neil Stanley</a>, an independent sleep consultant, says yes: &ldquo;The most effective way to improve your sleep is to fix your wake-up time in the morning.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>Stanley says that when your body gets used to the time it needs to wake up, <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v397/n6714/full/397029a0.html\">it can use the time it has to sleep as efficiently as possible</a>. &ldquo;Studies show that your body prepares to wake up one and a half hours prior to actually waking up. Your body craves regularity, so if you chop and change your sleep pattern, your body hasn&rsquo;t got a clue when it should prepare to wake up or not.&rdquo;</p><p>You could also do yourself a favour by ignoring society&rsquo;s views on sleep, he says. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s this social view that short sleeping is a good thing and should be encouraged &ndash; we&rsquo;re always hauling out the example of Margaret Thatcher and top CEOs who don&rsquo;t need much sleep. In fact, the amount of sleep you need is genetically determined as much as your height or shoe size. Some people need very little sleep, others need 11 or 12 hours to feel their best.&rdquo;</p><p>Stanley says that a lot of people with sleep issues actually don&rsquo;t have any problem sleeping, instead they have an expectation that they need to sleep for a certain amount of time. &ldquo;If we could all figure out what kind of sleeper we are, and live our life accordingly, that would make a huge difference to our quality of life,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Follow us <em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em><strong>Google+</strong></em></a>&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Health","Name":"Health","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Health","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:44:06.503434Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"00a9a33a-e393-4d09-8029-7e9d5bd1d8cb","Id":"wwfuture/section/health","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:52:37.074442Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/health"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:44:06.503434Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"00a9a33a-e393-4d09-8029-7e9d5bd1d8cb","Id":"wwfuture/section/health","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:52:37.074442Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/health"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/health","_id":"55dc627b7f6bada044cfc087"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Science & Environment","Name":"Science & Environment","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Science & Environment"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:51:45.984509Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"1aa4ccec-87b5-44b8-b5af-c553debaf6f6","Id":"wwfuture/section/science-environment","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:51:20.083392Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/science-environment"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/science-environment","_id":"55dc627b7f6bada044cfc098"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-07-07T00:19:19Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The people who need very little sleep","HeadlineShort":"The people who barely sleep","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Is it true that some people need only a few hours of sleep?

You won&rsquo;t recall a single aspect of the night&rsquo;s &ldquo;training&rdquo; &ndash; but that doesn&rsquo;t matter: your performance the next morning should be better, all the same.</p><p>The idea of learning as you sleep was once thought very unlikely, but there are several ways &ndash; both low- and hi-tech &ndash; to try to help you acquire new skills as you doze. While there is no method that will allow you to acquire a skill completely from scratch while you are unconscious, that doesn&rsquo;t mean that you still can&rsquo;t use sleep to boost your memory. During the night, our brain busily processes and consolidates our recollections from the day before, and there could be ways to enhance that process.</p><p>Given that we spend a third of our lives in the land of nod, it is little wonder that sleep learning has long captured the imagination of artists and writers. In most incarnations, it involved the unconscious mind absorbing new information from a recording playing in the background. In Aldous Huxley&rsquo;s Brave New World, for instance, a Polish boy learns English after having slept through a radio lecture by George Bernard Shaw; the authoritarian government soon uses the same technique to brainwash its subjects. More recently, in The Simpsons, Homer buys a tape to subliminally reduce his appetite as he sleeps, only to find that it is instead changing his vocabulary. When his wife, Marge, asks if his diet is working, the normally inarticulate Homer replies: &ldquo;Lamentably, no. My gastronomic rapacity knows no satiety&rdquo;.</p><p><strong>Bad science</strong></p><p>In reality, this particular kind of sleep learning is almost certainly impossible. Although some early studies suggested that subjects could pick up some facts as they slept, the researchers couldn&rsquo;t be sure that they hadn&rsquo;t just awoken to listen to the recording. To test those suspicions, Charles Simon and William Emmons attached electrodes on the scalps of their subjects, allowing them to be sure that they only played the tapes once the subjects were dozing. As they had suspected, <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/124/3231/1066.full.pdf\">the subjects learnt nothing</a> once they had dropped off. The results were published in the 1950s, but entrepreneurs over the years have still tried to cash-in on the attraction of effortless learning with various products &ndash; even though their methods had no scientific basis.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p023br7k\"}}</p><p>Despite being blind and deaf to new information, however, the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/health-27695144\">sleeping brain is far from idle</a>: it mulls over the day&rsquo;s experiences, sending memories from the hippocampus &ndash; where memories are first thought to form &ndash; to regions across the cortex, where they are held in long-term storage. &ldquo;It helps stabilise the memories and integrate them into a network of long-term memory,&rdquo; says <a href=\"https://www.medizin.uni-tuebingen.de/uktmedia/EINRICHTUNGEN/Institute/Institut+f%C3%BCr+Medizinische+Psychologie/PDF_Archiv/susanne_diekelmann_details.pdf\">Susanne Diekelmann at the University of Tubingen in Germany</a>. Sleep also helps us to generalise what we&rsquo;ve learnt, giving us the flexibility to apply the skills to new situations. So although you can&rsquo;t soak up new material, you might instead be able to cement the facts or skills learned throughout the day.</p><p><strong>Smell enhancer</strong></p><p>So far, at least four methods have shown promise. The simplest strategy harks back to the research of a 19th Century French nobleman named the Marquis d&rsquo;Hervey de Saint-Denys. As he explored ways to direct his dreams, the Marquis found that he could bring back certain memories with the relevant smells, tastes or sounds. In one experiment, he painted a scantily clad woman while chewing an orris root; when his servant then placed the root in his mouth as he slept, the tart flavour brought back visions of the same beautiful lady in the foyer of a theatre. She was wearing &ldquo;a costume that would have hardly been acceptable to the theatre committee&rdquo;, he wrote with delight in his book, Dreams and How to Guide Them. Another time, he asked the conductor of an orchestra to play certain waltzes whenever he danced with two particularly attractive women. He then rigged up a clock to a music box, so that it played the same tunes during the night, which apparently brought their handsome figures to his sleeping mind.</p><p>The Marquis simply wanted to seed his slumbers with pleasant (<a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22029480.700-sleeping-daredevil-the-first-dream-hacker.html?page=1#.U7qp0xAe_WY\">and sometimes lustful</a>) experiences, but it now looks like the same approach can also trigger the sleeping brain to replay the learning of skills or facts, reinforcing the memory in the process.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p023br6j\"}}</p><p>Diekelmann, for instance, asked her volunteers to play a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_%28game%29\">variation of the game Concentration</a>, in which they had to learn a specific pattern of objects in a grid before going to sleep in her lab. Some of the subjects were exposed to a subtle, artificial, odour as they played, and Diekelmann then wafted the same scent into their noses as they slept. Brain scans showed that these subjects had greater communication between the hippocampus and several cortical areas, compared to those without the cue &ndash; just the kind of activity that should lead to enhanced memory consolidation. Sure enough, those subjects remembered about <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v14/n3/abs/nn.2744.html\">84% of the object locations when they awoke, while a control group remembered just 61%.</a></p><p>It&rsquo;s not just sweet smells that could boost learning; as the Marquis found with his night-time waltzes, sounds might also be able to trigger recall, provided they do not wake you up in the process. In one study,<a href=\"http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/learn-music-while-you-sleep/\"> volunteers found it easier to master a musical game (a little like Guitar Hero) if they heard soft strains of the melody as they slept</a>. Bjorn Rasch at the University of Zurich, Switzerland, meanwhile, found that <a href=\"http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/06/23/cercor.bhu139.abstract\">the same setup helped Swiss German speakers learning Dutch vocabulary</a>, allowing them to remember about 10% more.</p><p><strong>Tech upgrade</strong></p><p>In the near future, technology may offer further ways of upgrading the brain&rsquo;s sleep cycles. Memory consolidation is thought to occur during specific, slow, oscillations of electrical activity, so the idea here is to subtly encourage those brain waves without waking the subject. Jan Born, at the University of Tubingen, has been at the forefront of these experiments. In 2004, he found that he could help amplify those signals using transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), which passes a small electric current across the skull, successfully <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/24/44/9985.long\">improving his subjects&rsquo; performance on a verbal memory test</a>.</p><p>More recently, he has turned to an even less-invasive form of stimulation, which uses a skullcap of electrodes to measure neural activity, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23583623\">while headphones deliver sounds that are in sync with the brain waves</a>. Born compares the auditory stimulation to the tiny push that you might give a child on a swing, so that it gently enhances neural activity that is already present in the brain. &ldquo;You deepen the slow wave sleep and make it more intense,&rdquo; says Born. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a more natural way of getting the system into a rhythm,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p023br9h\"}}</p><p>If the idea of going to sleep with a cumbersome headset doesn&rsquo;t appeal, Miriam Reiner at the Technion Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel may have a more attractive solution. She hopes to use a form of neurofeedback, which allows subjects to control their neural activity while awake. In her setup, an electrode attached to the subject&rsquo;s head feeds into a simple computer game, in which the subject is advised to drive a car with the power of their thoughts.</p><p>When the electrode records the right frequency of brainwaves, normally associated with memory consolidation during sleep, they accelerate; when they don&rsquo;t, it slows down. It typically takes just a few minutes for the subjects to start revving up the right brainwaves &ndash; and the change in mind set is palpable, says Reiner. &ldquo;I feel kind of relaxed &ndash; like when you&rsquo;re in a garden or walking along beach. It&rsquo;s just like being in a serene beautiful place.&rdquo; The idea is to kick-start memory consolidation straight after learning, which then gives the sleeping brain a head-start as it sets about reorganising the day&rsquo;s events. &ldquo;You create a seed that then grows during the night,&rdquo; says Reiner. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Play a tune</strong></p><p>To test the impact on learning, her subjects first learned a complex sequence of finger movements &ndash; a little like learning to play a tune on the piano &ndash; before taking 30 minutes of neurofeedback. The benefits were immediate &ndash; straight after the training they were about 10% better than the controls, suggesting the computer game really had begun to stabilise their memories as if they were actually asleep. Importantly, the improvements continued to grow as they were tested throughout the following week, supporting her theory that <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301051113002214\">neurofeedback could help memories to blossom as you sleep</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Needless to say, we will need to see bigger trials with many more subjects before these techniques should be recommended for everyday use. Since the experiments have so far used somewhat artificial tests of learning and memory, it would also be useful to see how they fare on more useful tasks; Reiner is beginning to take a few steps in this direction by testing whether her neurofeedback can help students learn the guitar. Diekelmann also thinks that we need to confirm that these memory hacks don&rsquo;t have unexpected consequences. &ldquo;If you enhance one set of memories, maybe you&rsquo;d impair another set,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p023brck\"}}</p><p>And we shouldn&rsquo;t shy away from the problems highlighted by fiction like Brave New World and The Simpsons, she says. Although she doesn&rsquo;t think that these methods could be used for brainwashing people against their will, she thinks we still need to question whether it would be right to start manipulating their children&rsquo;s memories, for instance, in these ways. &ldquo;Sleep is a vulnerable state.&rdquo; But she&rsquo;s keen to stress that these potential issues shouldn&rsquo;t deter interest in sleep learning. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very worthwhile. We just need to use it as responsibly as possible.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Easy tricks</strong></p><p>Once those questions have been addressed, there shouldn&rsquo;t be too many practical hurdles for people who wish to use the techniques for themselves, says Diekelmann. Many of her students and colleagues have already found that sensory cues during sleep can help them swat-up for exams. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very easy to apply,&rdquo; she says.&nbsp; And you can now buy EEG kits that work with your smartphone, potentially opening the door for games that help you boost memory consolidation. Even the hardware for <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/feb/05/focus-electronic-games-headset\">certain forms of tDCS became commercially available last year</a>, which could lead to kits designed to improve sleep learning.</p><p>Further evidence will be needed to show that the commercial kits can provide the benefits seen in the laboratory experiments, but Born is optimistic. &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s just a matter of time before it is used as a cognitive enhancer,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>At the very least, the research could change the way we view this often under-appreciated part of our lives. Sleep tends to be considered an unnecessary down-time that we try to conquer with coffee or Red Bull; we are all driven by the need to squeeze the day for every last drop of productivity. But we may take more time to catch 40 winks if we know that the most profitable part of the day really could involve doing nothing at all.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-07-22T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Can you learn in your sleep?","HeadlineShort":"How to learn while you sleep","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Sleep learning used to be a pipe dream.

Jet Lag derives from the simple fact that jets travel so fast they leave your body rhythms behind.\"</p><p>It&rsquo;s only in the last few decades that humans have been able to jump time zones, and we&rsquo;ve yet to find a way to adapt. To overcome its effects, travellers have turned to everything from taping plant seeds to acupressure points behind their ears to swallowing <a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/2013/11/12/travel/jetlag-cures/\">Viagra</a>.</p><p>But what actually happens to our bodies when we leap across time zones, and how is research helping us understand how to ease the effects?</p><p>Jet lag is the result of a disruption in our body&rsquo;s internal clocks. Our biological clocks drive our circadian rhythms, which anticipate dawn and dusk, and controls everything from blood pressure to how hungry we are. The system is synchronised to a period of around 24 hours &ndash; a &ldquo;master clock&rdquo; in our brain that is sensitive to our exposure to light coordinates all the body clocks within our organs and tissues.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01zn49v\"}}</p><p>All these clocks are controlled by the hormone melatonin, which is produced by the master clock when it gets dark to make us feel drowsy, and controls our body temperature when we sleep. When we fly to a different time zone (or work night shifts), all the clocks in our body go out of sync &ndash; or, to use the technical term, &ldquo;desynchronise&rdquo;. Each clock then takes a slightly different amount of time to re-adjust, which is why we feel so bad.</p><p>It takes most people a few days to fully adjust, depending on not only how many time zones have been crossed, but also the direction of travel. Adjusting to eastward travel is harder because of the way our internal body clock functions. As this clock follows a period of just over 24 hours, our bodies compensate every day by contracting this to synchronise with the regular 24-hour sun cycle. When you travel west, you gain several hours, and so your body has extra time to make this adjustment. Travel east, though, and your day is shortened, which makes the adjustment more difficult.</p><p><strong>Shift work</strong></p><p>So how possible is it to fool our biological clocks? &ldquo;There is no silver bullet &ndash; so far &ndash; to treat jet lag,&rdquo; says Horacio de la Iglesia, professor of biology at the University of Washington. &ldquo;Typically, the best way involves a combination of strategies that include restricting light exposure to specific times, restricting rest and meals, as well as activities such as walking and running to specific times, and the use of the hormone melatonin in very small amounts.&rdquo; Simon Archer from Surrey University agrees, at least in principle. &ldquo;A combined approach can be helpful, but in practice it may be difficult to get all the timings right &ndash; it may be very difficult not to be exposed to light at an inappropriate time.&rdquo; Also melatonin isn&rsquo;t available in every country, and people with epilepsy or those that use warfarin, a <em>drug</em> used to treat <em>blood clots, are advised against taking it</em>.</p><p>All these strategies are aimed at speeding up the adjustment of our multiple clocks to the new time zone. Work over the past 15 years has led to an amazing increase in our understanding of the circadian clock, light input and jet lag, says Stuart Peirson of the Nuffield Laboratory of Ophthalmology at Oxford University. The master clock is in the hypothalamus of the brain &ndash; the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN). This mechanism relies on so-called &ldquo;clock genes&rdquo;, expressed in the neurons of the SCN. Altering these genes also alters the 24-hour behaviour of the organism &ndash; &ldquo;be it a fly, a mouse or a human,&rdquo; says Peirson.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01zn4zv\"}}</p><p>Together with his team, he has been studying how light changes the expression of clock genes in the SCN. Increased expression of certain clock genes effectively moves the molecular &lsquo;hands&rsquo; of the clock to the correct time, says Peirson &ndash; but there seems to be a limit on how much the clock can be shifted: it&rsquo;s just one hour per day. &ldquo;Our work in this area has identified a natural brake &ndash; a protein called SIK1 &ndash; that is activated by light and actively prevents the clock shifting. Normally it would take five or six days to adjust to a six-hour shift in time zone. &ldquo;When this [SIK1] mechanism is blocked, it enables mice to shift their clocks much more quickly &ndash; shifting six hours in two-to-three days,&rdquo; says Peirson.</p><p>Work published last year by researchers in Japan suggests a hormone plays a key role in re-setting the body clock. Mice lacking receptors for the hormone arginine vasopressin were much less affected by jet lag and adjusted more quickly to time shifts, says Peirson. However, turning this intriguing finding into any potential jet-lag cure will be <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/03/meet-the-mice-that-are-immune-to-jet-lag/\">far from simple</a>.</p><p><strong>Be prepared</strong></p><p>Some scientists are looking at how we can avoid jet lag by preparing for it in advance. &ldquo;We believe it is important for many people to start the process of shifting your internal rhythms before the flight, so that you arrive with little or no jet lag,&rdquo; says Charmane Eastman at Rush University in Chicago, Illinois. &ldquo;Most recommendations and computer-based programs only make recommendations for what to do after landing in the new time zone.&rdquo;</p><p>Together with colleagues, Eastman has been investigating how people could reset their body clocks before flying. The scientists gave volunteers melatonin sold over the counter, and altered their light patterns using a big light box. They found that a combination of as little as 0.5 mg of melatonin (common doses are 3 and 5mg) with morning intermittent bright light advanced people&rsquo;s sleep schedule, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3841985/\">resetting the circadian clock earlier in time</a>, and thus making all the circadian rhythms of the body happen earlier.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01zn52n\"}}</p><p>So to avoid jet lag when flying east, says Eastman, you have to take melatonin in the afternoon for a number of days before the journey, and use the light box in the mornings to wake up earlier each day. This can be done for the number of days equal to the number of time zones that will be crossed, helping the body to completely adjust to the new time before the trip. Most people, however, use fewer days, and then jet lag upon arrival is reduced and you get over your remaining jet lag sooner, says Eastman. When flying west, Eastman recommends using the light box at night, and perhaps taking melatonin in the morning.</p><p><strong>Speed shift</strong></p><p>There might also be ways to adjust the body clock without drugs. Another group of scientists has designed an app called Entrain that uses mathematical modelling to determine how our body can shift from one time zone to another in the quickest way possible. If users type in the timezone they are travelling to the app calculates a schedule that tells the user when they should expose themselves to light.</p><p>The researchers say it&rsquo;s probably easiest for travellers to divide their day into two parts, one where they seek as much light as possible and another where they should try to be in darkness &ndash; essentially corresponding to dawn and dusk. The software &ldquo;should allow an individual to get over jet lag in less than half the time than if one used other well-known recommendations,&rdquo; says Daniel Forger of the University of Michigan, a co-author of the study. </p><p>The schedules themselves haven't been tested in controlled environments; the data people submit will be used to test the efficacy of the recommendations in the real world &ndash; and the team says they have data from over 5,000 people so far. &ldquo;Hopefully our schedules can be integrated into more devices so that they become easier to follow,&rdquo; says lead developer of Entrain, mathematician Olivia Walch at the University of Michigan. &ldquo;Maybe hotels could offer 10,000 lux lights so that people can get bright daylight when they need it to push their clocks in the right direction.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><strong><em>Disclaimer<br /> </em></strong><em>All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

Although modern science precludes the existence of the soul, it does suggest that there is a kernel of truth in this old saying: it turns out the eyes not only reflect what is happening in the brain but may also influence how we remember things and make decisions.</p><blockquote><p> We're not always conscious of how our eyes move&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Our eyes are constantly moving, and while some of those movements are under conscious control, many of them occur subconsciously. When we read, for instance, we make a series of very quick eye movements called saccades that fixate rapidly on one word after another. When we enter a room, we make larger sweeping saccades as we gaze around. Then there are the small, involuntary eye movements we make as we walk, to compensate for the movement of our head and stabilise our view of the world. And, of course, our eyes dart around during the &lsquo;rapid eye movement&rsquo; (REM) phase of sleep.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rxjrb\"}}</p><p>What is now becoming clear is that some of our eye movements may actually reveal our thought process.</p><p>Research published last year shows that <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003854\">pupil dilation is linked to the degree of uncertainty</a> during decision-making: if somebody is less sure about their decision, they feel heightened arousal, which causes the pupils to dilate. This change in the eye may also reveal <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/5/E618.full\">what a decision-maker is about to say</a>: one group of researchers, for example, found that watching for dilation made it possible to predict when a cautious person used to saying &lsquo;no&rsquo; was about to make the tricky decision to say &lsquo;yes&rsquo;.</p><blockquote><p> If somebody is unsure about a decision, their pupils dilate </p></blockquote><p>Watching the <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982210000187\">eyes can even help predict what number a person has in mind</a>. Tobias Loetscher and his colleagues at the University of Zurich recruited 12 volunteers and tracked their eye movements while they reeled off a list of 40 numbers.</p><p>They found that the direction and size of the participants&rsquo; eye movements accurately predicted whether the number they were about to say was bigger or smaller than the previous one &ndash; and by how much. Each volunteer&rsquo;s gaze shifted up and to the right just before they said a bigger number, and down and to the left before a smaller one. The bigger the shift from one side to the other, the bigger the difference between the numbers.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rxjp3\"}}</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rxjqd\"}}</p><p>This suggests that we somehow link abstract number representations in the brain with movement in space. But the study does not tell us which comes first: whether thinking of a particular number causes changes in eye position, or whether the eye position influences our mental activity. In 2013, researchers in Sweden published evidence that it&rsquo;s the latter that may be at work: eye movements may actually <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/10/28/0956797613498260\">facilitate memory retrieval</a>.</p><blockquote><p> Wandering eyes? It may aid your memory&nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>They recruited 24 students and asked each one to carefully examine a series of objects displayed to them in one corner of a computer screen. The participants were then told to listen to a series of statements about some of the objects they had seen, such as &ldquo;The car was facing to the left&rdquo; and asked to indicate as quickly as possible if each was true or false. Some participants were allowed to let their eyes roam about freely; others were asked to fix their gaze on a cross at the centre of the screen, or the corner where the object had appeared, for example.</p><p>The researchers found that those who were allowed to move their eyes spontaneously during recall performed significantly better than those who fixed on the cross. Interestingly, though, participants who were told to fix their gaze in the corner of the screen in which objects had appeared earlier performed better than those told to fix their gaze in another corner. This suggests that the more closely the participants&rsquo; eye movements during information encoding corresponded with those that occurred during retrieval of the information, the better they were at remembering the objects. Perhaps that&rsquo;s because eye movements help us to recall the spatial relationships between objects in the environment at the time of encoding.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rygdk\"}}</p><p>These eye movements can occur unconsciously. &ldquo;When people are looking at scenes they have encountered before, their eyes are frequently drawn to information they have already seen, even when they have no conscious memory of it,&rdquo; says Roger Johansson, a psychologist at Lund University who led the study.</p><p><strong>Vision control</strong></p><p>Watching eye movements can also be used to nudge people&rsquo;s decisions. One recent study showed &ndash; maybe worryingly &ndash; that eye-tracking can be exploited to <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/112/13/4170.full\">influence the moral decisions we take</a>.</p><p>Researchers asked participants complex moral questions such as &ldquo;Can murder ever be justified?&rdquo; and then displayed, on a computer screen, alternative answers (&ldquo;sometimes justifiable&rdquo; or &ldquo;never justifiable&rdquo;). By tracking the participants&rsquo; eye movements, and removing the two answer options immediately after a participant had spent a certain amount of time gazing at one of the two options, the researchers found that they could nudge the participants to provide that particular option as their answer.</p><blockquote><p> &nbsp;Skilled salespeople could use eye movements to influence buying decisions </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t give them any more information,&rdquo; says neuroscientist Daniel Richardson of University College London, senior author of study. &ldquo;We simply waited for their own decision-making processes to unfold and interrupted them at exactly the right point. We made them change their minds just by controlling when they made the decision.&rdquo;</p><p>Richardson adds that successful salespeople may have some insight into this, and use it to be more persuasive with clients. &ldquo;We think of persuasive people as good talkers, but maybe they&rsquo;re also observing the decision-making process,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Maybe good salespeople can spot the exact moment you&rsquo;re wavering towards a certain choice, and then offer you a discount or change their pitch.&rdquo;</p><p>The ubiquity of eye-tracking apps for smartphones and other hand-held devices raises the possibility of altering people&rsquo;s decision-making process remotely. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re shopping online, they might bias your decision by offering free shipping at the moment you shift your gaze to a particular product.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02rxjr3\"}}</p><p>Thus, eye movements can both reflect and influence higher mental functions such as memory and decision-making, and betray our thoughts, beliefs, and desires. This knowledge may give us ways of improving our mental functions &ndash; but it also leaves us vulnerable to subtle manipulation by other people.</p><p>&ldquo;The eyes are like a window into our thought processes, and we just don&rsquo;t appreciate how much information might be leaking out of them,&rdquo; says Richardson. &ldquo;They could potentially reveal things that a person might want to suppress, such as implicit racial bias.&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;I can see eye-tracking apps being used for, say, supportive technologies that figure out what phone function you need and then help out,&rdquo; he adds, &ldquo;but if they&rsquo;re left on all the time they could be used to track all sorts of other things. This would provide much richer information, and raises the possibility of unwittingly sharing our thoughts with others.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em><strong>Google+</strong></em></a>&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":null,"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-05-22T01:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"How the eyes betray your thoughts","HeadlineShort":"How the eyes betray your thoughts","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Look closer at eye movements and you can find out what’s happening inside somebody’s head, says Mo Costandi.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":[],"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Look closer at eye movements and you can find out what’s happening inside somebody’s head, says Mo Costandi.","SummaryShort":"Watch closely, and you can read minds","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-21T23:53:39.795123Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"12ae01b8-1b4a-4b0f-a6a4-cf921ed6f3f4","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150521-how-the-eyes-betray-your-thoughts","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-28T13:18:20.448531Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150521-how-the-eyes-betray-your-thoughts"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150521-how-the-eyes-betray-your-thoughts","_id":"55dc63b27f6bada044d0b2a4"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>Few experiences are as maddening as a restless night. Sleep should, in theory, be the most natural and effortless activity in the world, yet insomnia is common to many of us. To add to the frustration, it is now becoming clear that the hours you spend in bed are just as <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20130726-the-sleep-secrets-of-ceos\">important to your physical and mental health</a> as those spent walking, talking and eating. A good night&rsquo;s rest can help regulate your mood, sharpen your attention, and boost your memory, while ailments from <a href=\"http://cpr.sagepub.com/content/21/1/57.abstract\">heart disease</a> to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2768214/\">diabetes</a> have been linked to those struggling to get sufficient sleep.</p><p>Simply willing yourself to fall to sleep can make its sweet relief even more elusive, and we resort to all sorts of measures to help ease our journey to the land of nod. But what works, and what doesn&rsquo;t? BBC Future has reviewed the evidence to find out.</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t&hellip; drink caffeine after dark</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6rvr\"}}<strong></p><p></strong>Avoiding caffeine is obvious advice, but it's worth repeating. The good news is that you may not need to be as strict as once thought. If you have your last coffee in the early afternoon, most of the caffeine will have been flushed out of your body by 11pm. So although avoiding coffee or tea within <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24235903\">6 hours of going to bed</a> will make it much easier to drop off, it is unclear whether there are any benefits to abstaining outside that time period. It&rsquo;s also worth noting that not everyone is affected by caffeine equally; some people have a gene variant which means they are much less sensitive to caffeine&rsquo;s effects &ndash; so it&rsquo;s worth experimenting with what works for you.</p><p><strong>Do&hellip; keep a sleep diary</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6rzl\"}}</p><p>Cutting down on alcohol, taking regular exercise, avoiding daytime naps and following a rigid bedtime schedule <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1087079214001002\">can also improve your &ldquo;sleep hygiene&rdquo; and set you up for deeper slumbers.</a> And it should go without saying that you should avoid doing anything strenuous or stressful within a few hours of sleep time &ndash; a habit that is easier said than remembered. For this reason, some studies suggest keeping a sleep diary of your activity before bed, which <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23813124\">helps to ensure you avoid the worst triggers</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Don&rsquo;t&hellip; curl up with your favourite reading device</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6s2g\"}}</p><p>Although the act of reading may be soporific, changes in the way we consume literature could be sending your bodily rhythms into disarray. Many e-readers are backlit with blue frequencies of light &ndash; which can fool the brain into thinking that it&rsquo;s still daytime. Perhaps for this reason, a recent study found that reading on these devices for a few hours before bed seems to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25535358\">suppress melatonin</a> (the sleep hormone) and therefore makes it harder to doze off, compared to a traditional paperback. The same goes for tablets, MP3 players and smartphones. So if you want to feel refreshed the next day, the bedroom may be the perfect place for an analogue revival.</p><p><strong>Do&hellip; try some &ldquo;slumber-foods&rdquo;</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6rgj\"}}</p><p>According to the old wives&rsquo; tale, cheese and chocolate before bed will give you nightmares. That remains to be <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120417-does-cheese-give-you-nightmares\">proven scientifically</a>, but your day&rsquo;s meals can certainly influence how quickly you get to sleep, and the quality of your slumbers. Meals high in carbohydrates and protein (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812543\">especially oily fish</a>), but low in fat, show moderate benefits to overall sleep duration and quality, provided they are eaten at least an hour before you plan to drop off. Food rich in tryptophan (an important precursor to several neurotransmitters), and the hormone melatonin, might also help regulate the body clock <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4008810/\">to prepare your brain for a more restful night</a>. A recent review, charting the evidence so far, suggests that about 300g of turkey, 200g of pumpkin seeds, or a glass of tart cherry juice, could give you the necessary dose of these compounds &ndash; though hard evidence is lacking.</p><p><strong>Do&hellip; sleep in a new position (or learn the didgeridoo)</p><p></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j6yq0\"}}</p><p>Many restless nights can be linked to sleep apnoea &ndash; a condition linked to snoring, in which the airways becomes constricted when you are unconscious. Often, the sleeper doesn&rsquo;t even realise what has woken them up with a start &ndash; despite the fact that it can happen many times in one night. There are several causes, but some cases may be easily solved by switching from lying on your back, to sleeping on your <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25618193\">front</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24118690\">side</a>. Another, more left-field suggestion is to learn the didgeridoo; perhaps because it strengthens muscles in the respiratory system. A small study in the <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7536/266\">British Medical Journal</a> found that learning the instrument gave some sufferers a smoother sleep with fewer interruptions. Certainly not a solution for everyone &ndash; particularly those with close neighbours trying to get some sleep themselves.</p><p>As you may have gathered, there is no fool-proof path to a sleepless night. But by considering the different cocktail of factors that may make you toss and turn in bed, you can at least start to experiment with your habits to see what works for you. It certainly beats counting sheep.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.<br /></em></p><p><strong>Further reading: </strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zsspn39\">{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j8p7c\"}}</a></p><p><em>BBC iWonder investigates <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zsspn39\">what's stopping your slumber</a>.</em></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20141013-can-you-become-a-morning-person\">{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02j8jgc\"}}</a></p><p><em>Drowsy in the mornings?

is telling me the story of the end of her life. At least, it is the end of the life she used to know.</p><p>Three years ago, government soldiers came to her home in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo and arrested her for working with the political opposition. They took her to their base and locked her in a darkened room. While incarcerated she was the victim of degrading treatment &ndash; all she is prepared to share about the experience is that she was raped. After three days she was released, and left bleeding and disorientated on the side of a road. She was rescued by a woman who took her to hospital and contacted her family. They arranged for her escape to Turkey. A few weeks after crossing the border she discovered she was pregnant. She doesn&rsquo;t know if the child is by her husband or the man who raped her. Her husband, a political activist, disappeared the day she was taken. Her brother is also missing. Recently she heard that her sister has been killed.</p><p>Traumatised by this fracturing of her life, Eugenie (not her real name) was referred to a therapy centre in Istanbul that specialises in the treatment of victims of mass trauma events such as war, torture, earthquakes and sexual violence. The Center for Behaviour Research and Therapy &ndash; <a href=\"http://dabatem.org/\">known by its Turkish acronym as Dabatem</a> &ndash; is run by the clinical psychologist Ebru Salcioglu, an expert in anxiety disorders, and the psychiatrist Metin Basoglu, former head of trauma studies at the Institute of Psychiatry at King&rsquo;s College London. Their mission, grounded in 25 years of research into how people experience trauma, is to make effective therapy available to the huge numbers of victims in the developing world who would otherwise receive no help.</p><blockquote><p> While some people understandably crumble after extraordinarily harrowing events, others, like Eugenie have an extraordinary capacity to rebound and survive </p></blockquote><p>The psychologists had arranged for me to meet some of their clients in Istanbul. Eugenie is the first to turn up. She is composed and self-assured, and remarkably forthright about her demons. Yet after a while it becomes apparent that she has come not so much to describe her downfall as her survival. She says her fears no longer control her. She is functioning pretty well. She seems proud, and also grateful. &ldquo;Before my treatment, I wasn&rsquo;t able to tell my story to anyone,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was dead. Now I feel like telling it. It&rsquo;s my story.&rdquo;</p><p>You might think, given what happened to her, that a recovery of this scale would take months of intensive therapy. Yet Salcioglu says she has seen Eugenie for just eight sessions, and that she began to get better after four. Many of their clients have reported a similar rate of improvement.</p><p>Their successes challenge many of our common notions about the resilience of the human mind. While some people understandably crumble after extraordinarily harrowing events, others, like Eugenie have an extraordinary capacity to rebound and survive. Understanding why could lead us to help many more recover and grow after their experiences.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02zhpsv\"}}</p><p>Tales of extreme resilience are very rare in the media; after every tragedy, we are more often reminded of the permanent scars an event can leave on the mind. &ldquo;Watching television, you&rsquo;d think every soldier returning from Iraq and Afghanistan was going to fall apart, that they&rsquo;re walking time bombs,&rdquo; says Donald Meichenbaum, who helped treat survivors of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the 1999 Columbine High School shooting and the terrorist attacks of 9/11.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s true that a good proportion of people suffering trauma do carry mental illness. On average, around <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0059236\">25% of people</a> exposed to a life-threatening or violent event develop post-traumatic stress disorder, or related disorders that don&rsquo;t meet <a href=\"http://www.ptsd.va.gov/professional/PTSD-overview/dsm5_criteria_ptsd.asp\">its strict diagnostic criteria</a>. Their lives can revolve around their symptoms, which include nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, disrupted moods or cognition, hypervigilance and irritability. Usually they harbour irrational fears that cause them to avoid situations that remind them of what happened.</p><p>Traumatised survivors of war crimes, and victims of torture and rape &ndash; such as Eugenie &ndash; typically fear sleeping in the dark. They have difficulty watching anything violent on TV. If they are women they are usually afraid of men and may choose to miss their bus or train if it carries a preponderance of men. Eugenie dreaded being in crowds, yet she also couldn&rsquo;t bear spending even five minutes on her own. At night, she says, &ldquo;I would see the soldiers in my mind and all they did to me.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Post-traumatic growth&rdquo;</p><p></strong>Left untreated, those symptoms can persist for years. In 2004, Greek psychiatrists discovered that survivors of the 1953 earthquake on the island of Cephalonia, which killed 455 and left many homeless, were still experiencing flashbacks and nightmares, <a href=\"http://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/2008/04000/The_Psychological_Impact_of_a_Catastrophic.13.aspx\">more than half a century later</a>.</p><p>Yet it&rsquo;s still striking that the majority of people who live through an earthquake, terrorist attack or physical abuse do not experience lasting psychiatric symptoms. &ldquo;People are more resilient than we give them credit for,&rdquo; says Simon Wessely, professor of psychological medicine at the Institute of Psychiatry, King&rsquo;s College London. When Wessely&rsquo;s team asked 1,000 Londoners about their emotional state in the days following the suicide bombings on 7 July 2005, <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/331/7517/606\">only one in 100 said they felt they needed professional help</a>. A similar survey among residents of New York City after 9/11 by George Bonanno at Columbia University found that a large majority suffered <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/17/3/181.short\">no trauma symptoms at all during the six months that followed</a> (though <a href=\"http://www.survivorsoftorture.org/files/pdf/galea-vlahov-resnick-etal2003.pdf\">PTSD rates among those living or working near Ground Zero were around 20%</a>). This rather undermines the received wisdom that everyone in the vicinity of a disaster needs help.</p><p>Such extreme differences in the way people cope are striking, and puzzling. What makes some people more resilient, so they require less help and can pull through quicker than others? And why do a minority even manage what psychologists call &ldquo;post-traumatic growth&rdquo;, living deeper, more meaningful lives than before?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02zhqt4\"}}</p><p>Some clues come from the High Valley Resilience Study at Harvard Medical School, which followed a group of young people who had been hospitalised in their early teens due to severe psychosis. Following patients from the late 70s to the early 90s, it found that a minority surprised everyone by going on to lead normal lives in adulthood. These survivors did not appear to possess any remarkable innate attributes. Instead, what set them apart was the way they framed the story of their illness and how they integrated it into their personal narratives.</p><p>This suggests that resilience and recovery do not require extraordinary resources or an innate toughness, but rather a willingness to adapt to circumstances. The child psychologist Ann Masten calls this &ldquo;ordinary magic&rdquo;. Masten, who studies at the <a href=\"http://www.cehd.umn.edu/icd/people/faculty/cpsy/masten.html\">Institute of Child Development at the University of Minnesota</a>, points to <a href=\"http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/road-resilience.aspx\">several key factors</a>, such as connecting with a wider community, sharing your experience with others and developing a sense of meaning in life.</p><blockquote><p> Re-framing your life after a deep upset &ndash; getting your story right &ndash; can require considerable energy and imagination </p></blockquote><p>In theory, these resources are open to anyone. But that doesn&rsquo;t mean they are easy to apply. Re-framing your life after a deep upset &ndash; getting your story right &ndash; can require considerable energy and imagination. All traumatised people have lost something. Usually the thing they have lost is the safe, predictable world that they knew; it can touch a person at the deepest existential level. &ldquo;Trauma creates a rupture in a person&rsquo;s life story,&rdquo; says Stephen Joseph, a psychologist at the University of Nottingham. &ldquo;It teaches them about the shortness of life, the preciousness of life, the closeness of mortality, the possibility that their loved ones may be gone tomorrow.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Seizing life</p><p></strong>The challenges of drawing on your natural resilience are evident in the city of Van in the far east of Turkey, which I visited after my conversation with Eugenie. It is located in the East Anatolian highlands, a thinly populated, tectonically lively massif of snowy peaks, weathered foothills and scrubby plateaus. Today, the city is best known for an earthquake that killed more than 600 of its residents and left tens of thousands temporarily homeless.</p><p>The earthquake struck at 13:41 local time on 23 October 2011. It lasted 25 seconds and caused the partial or total collapse of thousands of houses and office buildings in Van and surrounding villages. Hundreds of aftershocks followed, then two weeks later came a second large earthquake, which killed 40 more. By mid-November the city was unrecognisable. As in Nepal recently, most of the surviving population were living in tents in the open since the houses were too dangerous to enter.</p><blockquote><p> After the earthquake, the Turkish government was not equipped to meet psychological needs </p></blockquote><p>By early 2012, most people had moved to 29,000 steel mobile container units organised by the Turkish government. The government was quick to coordinate food, water, health and other services, to meet basic needs. But it was not equipped to meet psychological needs. So a group of psychologists and counsellors from Yuzuncu Yil University in Van and the Mother Child Education Foundation (<a href=\"http://www.acev.org/en/\">Acev</a>) in Istanbul set up a counselling centre in one of the containers. Over the months that followed they treated hundreds of people, including 200 children who had developed problems such as bed-wetting, aggression, obsessive-compulsive habits, sleeplessness, nightmares and a persistent fear of being separated from their parents.</p><p>The counselling centre is still operating. Its leader, Fuat Tanhan, tells me that patients with all kinds of issues come here. Some are still indirectly affected by the earthquake, which shook to the surface previously unacknowledged issues within families and relationships. &ldquo;Everybody lost something, whether it was a family member, a friend, a house, possessions, or just a sense of security.&rdquo;</p><p>Around a quarter developed PTSD, yet the rest showed resilience in the face of the losses. Their strength seemed to come from an ability to reappraise and reform their lives, to think about their lives anew, form closer links to their families, and to change behaviours and habits. One of them says he gave up smoking immediately, for instance &ndash; although others became more hedonistic. Whatever their choice, the decision to seize life and start anew seemed to define their survival. &ldquo;Living through a catastrophic event means you face death,&rdquo; says Tanhan. &ldquo;You have the sense you can die any time. This changes your life.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02zhqft\"}}</p><p>The idea that becoming acutely aware of your own mortality can trigger dramatic changes in attitudes has a long history in psychology. In his 1974 Pulitzer Prize-winning book <a href=\"http://www.ernestbecker.org/a-five-part-introdution-to-ernest-becker.html\">The Denial of Death</a> the psychiatrist Ernest Becker proposed that much of what characterises our humanness &ndash; our culture, belief systems, sense of self and belonging &ndash; is shaped by our need to offset the inevitability of dying. Survivors of traumatic events are brought nose-to-nose with this reality, and they must find ways to temper it, to assure themselves that their lives count for something and that they will not merely end up as &ldquo;food for worms&rdquo;, as Becker put it. The task, he wrote, is to create narratives that are &ldquo;of lasting worth and meaning&rdquo;, that &ldquo;outlive or outshine death and decay&rdquo;.</p><p>It seems the ones who respond best are able to re-imagine their lives in the most positive ways. The Austrian psychiatrist Viktor Frankl, during his internment in Auschwitz and Dachau concentration camps during World War Two, helped his fellow prisoners endure the horror around them by getting them to focus on the lives they might lead after the war &ndash; the work they would do, or the nurturing of their children. In his most famous book, Man&rsquo;s Search for Meaning, first published in 1946, he observed that prisoners who lost faith in the future lost their &ldquo;spiritual hold&rdquo; on themselves, and quickly declined mentally and physically. He also noted that this was less likely to happen to those with faith. Religions, with their grand scripts for life and death, offer multiple opportunities for dealing with trauma, not all of them successful.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02zhxbw\"}}</p><p>Prayer and ritual were common in Van, where a sociologist told me: &ldquo;Right after the earthquake I looked at the Koran, and when I saw some verses that I could relate to the incident, I felt deeply relieved.&rdquo; Religious engagement was the most common coping strategy reported by the earthquake survivors, followed closely by family support. These two are doubtless intertwined, since people tend to pray or conduct religious rituals together.</p><blockquote><p> Relinquishing control is an ultimate form of control </p></blockquote><p>Religion may also offer a feeling of certainty where none exists. In Van, a place that can seem utterly vulnerable to the forces of nature that surround it, delegating responsibility to a higher being is a way of managing the situation. &ldquo;Earthquakes are totally unpredictable, therefore totally uncontrollable,&rdquo; says Basoglu. &ldquo;Relinquishing control is an ultimate form of control.&rdquo;</p><p>Still, bouncing back from trauma does not always require us to build an ambitious existential vision for our place in the world. Frankl stressed that the key was to find meaning <em>in</em> life, rather than the meaning <em>of</em> life. &ldquo;Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!&rdquo; he exhorted his patients.</p><p>The challenge is finding ways to encourage people to make this transition naturally, for themselves. Meichenbaum, the clinical psychologist, says he can tell just from listening to his patients talk and the metaphors they use how well they are likely to cope with their bad experiences and how resilient they will be. Successful adapters tell lucid, forward-looking stories about themselves that join their past to their future. The 25% of people who (on average) go on to develop PTSD, however, tend to be incoherent, fragmented and stuck on negative memories. They describe themselves as &ldquo;prisoners of the past&rdquo;, &ldquo;empty inside&rdquo;, &ldquo;not worthy&rdquo;, and the like. A therapist, says Meichenbaum, should get them to spin another version of their story, one that includes an account of how they survived, how they managed to get to the therapist&rsquo;s door, and the path they will follow from there.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02zhntx\"}}</p><p>Retelling your life-story is not the only way to recover from trauma, however &ndash; there are many other behaviours that can help you rebuild your mental fortress. Who you mix with may also be crucial.</p><blockquote><p> Retelling your life-story is not the only way to recover from trauma </p></blockquote><p>Before he started working with refugees and earthquake survivors, Basoglu was known for his studies on the psychological effects of torture. One of his most remarkable findings was that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9403913\">torture survivors who are members of political organisations suffer fewer psychological problems afterwards than those with no political involvement</a>, even when they are tortured more severely. Basoglu couldn&rsquo;t be sure what provided this apparent immunity, but among his favoured theories was that being politically active gives someone &ldquo;a belief system whereby torture is appraised as merely an instrument of repression used by the regime to protect the interests of the ruling class&rdquo;. In other words, torture may be less disturbing for activists because it doesn&rsquo;t controvert their fundamental understanding of how the world works &ndash; whereas for the unprepared, it is likely to be crushing.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Moral injury&rdquo;</p><p></strong>This may explain why military personnel tend to fare better than civilians when kidnapped, since surviving as a captive could be construed as part of their mission. Nevertheless if a soldier experiences something that conflicts with his deep-held beliefs or sense of order, he is as vulnerable as anyone. Killing an enemy soldier, for example, or failing to prevent the death of a colleague, can trigger what psychologists call &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272735809000920\">moral injury</a>&rdquo;, a precursor for a range of pathological behaviours including alcohol abuse, hopelessness, self-loathing, persistent guilt and an inclination to re-cast oneself as immoral, beyond redemption or irreparably damaged.</p><p>Friendly fire can have the same effect, says Simon Wessely, who in addition to his role at the Institute of Psychiatry is a psychiatric consultant to the British Army. &ldquo;Being shot by the Taliban is one thing. That&rsquo;s in the rules of the game. Being accidentally bombed by the Americans is completely different. That&rsquo;s a violation of professionalism. It disrupts your worldview. It has a much more dramatic impact on PTSD.&rdquo;</p><p>If a distortion of identity is a risk factor for trauma, a shared identity &ndash; turning to others &ndash; is a defence against it. Another reason political activists report less distress during torture, and military personnel during captivity, could be their affiliation to their group. Knowing that you have <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140514-how-extreme-isolation-warps-minds\">buddies who are rooting for you</a> is gladdening and reassuring. Identifying with others and confiding in them is also critical to recovery from trauma. In his work with survivors of large-scale terrorist attacks in the US, Meichenbaum has found that how a victim responds to a tragedy depends on the level of support they get from close friends and family in the hours and days afterwards. By the same token, survivors of the 2005 London bombings who couldn&rsquo;t immediately get through to their loved ones on their mobiles (usually because the networks were jammed or overloaded) were far more likely to suffer a substantial stress reaction, according to <a href=\"http://www.bmj.com/content/331/7517/606\">Wessely&rsquo;s analysis of the aftermath</a>.</p><blockquote><p> Social connection can help people reach out beyond their own fear and discordance to something grander, a kind of self-transcendence </p></blockquote><p>Social connection is an effective remedy not only because of the comfort it brings, but also because it can help people reach out beyond their own fear and discordance to something grander and more meaningful, a kind of self-transcendence. It grounds them in a cultural identity, or in a social network, that offers an alternative perspective.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02zhn83\"}}</p><p>I could see this with Eugenie. A long way from her home in DR Congo, she has found a community of exiles in Istanbul, and a support system in her therapists, who have helped pull her out of her dark imaginings and connect with the world around her.</p><p>It was also evident in Van, when I meet Suvat Parin, head of the Yuzuncu Yil University sociology department. &nbsp;He has always lived here, an authority on the social dynamics of the community and, lately, how it responds to trauma.</p><p>He tells me that in a poor, relatively deprived population like Van&rsquo;s, social bonds make up for the lack of resources, providing people with a survival strategy. When I ask him to explain, he describes what happened to his own family after the earthquake. &ldquo;As soon as it stopped we started calling everyone, our relatives, asking about people, where they were, what happened to them, did they survive. It was quite intense. Within two hours we were all gathered in the same place, a group of a hundred people carrying the same surname. We had everything we needed, food, medicine. It was all addressed in a collective manner. It gave us psychological leverage, a means to cope with things. Because you knew you were not alone, that there were people behind you.&rdquo;</p><p>Social resilience, as well as being culturally dependent, cannot account for all the nuances of a community&rsquo;s response to tragedy. It is puzzling, for example, that women, despite being better than men at building ties and sharing emotions, almost always report higher rates of PTSD after a traumatic event. But <em>lack</em> of social support likely explains why British soldiers returning to civvy street after serving in Iraq and Afghanistan &ndash; thus losing ties with their &ldquo;bands of brothers&rdquo; &ndash; were <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9566.12022/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=false\">more vulnerable to PTSD and other mental disorders than their colleagues who remained in service</a>. It may explain why so many Vietnam veterans became psychiatric casualties after returning home to widespread public condemnation &ndash; a social alienation that according to <a href=\"http://www.killology.com/bio.htm\">military psychologist Dave Grossman</a> amplified their trauma to &ldquo;a staggering degree of horror&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02zhrp4\"}}</p><p>The traumatised patients who come for help at Dabatem&rsquo;s treatment centre in Istanbul have one symptom in common: they are all consumed by fear. This makes them avoidant, and as a result their lives are highly dysfunctional. Salcioglu and Basoglu say the therapist&rsquo;s task is to get them to do the things they avoid &ndash; sleeping in the dark, walking in a crowd, watching the news &ndash; and to keep doing them and not to run from them until they understand that their fear is unrealistic and they can tolerate it. &ldquo;The critical recovery process is exposure,&rdquo; says Basoglu. &ldquo;You confront fear and you learn to deal with it. You learn to exercise control over it, instead of letting it control you.&rdquo;</p><p>A distinguishing feature of Dabatem&rsquo;s behavioural approach &ndash; which has none of the cognitive elements often used by therapists &ndash; is the speed with which it can be rolled out in disaster zones, where tens of thousands of people may require help. For earthquake survivors, they have designed a treatment programme that can be delivered by a health professional in a single session in which the therapist teaches the patient how to confront their fears and overcome them. This single-session approach has been controversial, since it suggests the patient&rsquo;s relationship with the therapist is not as crucial as some believe. Still, it has been successful: clinical trials with earthquake survivors suffering chronic PTSD showed that <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jts.20011/abstract\">80% of them improved significantly</a> over the 12 weeks following an initial consultation with one of their therapists. (After six weeks only 4% of the control group had shown any improvement so for ethical reasons the researchers merged them with the treatment group). Preliminary results from a trial with 60 war refugees indicate that <a href=\"http://dabatem.org/current-research/treatment-of-refugees/\">93% were much recovered after 12 sessions, and that many required fewer</a>.</p><blockquote><p> The potential to recover is in the genes. The question is how to mobilise it </p></blockquote><p>Like many other psychologists, Basoglu is optimistic that anyone floored by a traumatic event can rally to live a fully functional life, and sometimes to flourish in a way they hadn&rsquo;t before, though they may need guiding. &ldquo;The potential to recover is in the genes. The question is how to mobilise it.&rdquo; At Dabatem, the aim is not to help patients develop their autobiographical narratives or find a grand arc of meaning. It is to normalise their behaviours so they&rsquo;re able to do this themselves. Once they have squared up to their fears, says Basoglu, the changes can be astonishing.</p><p>On my last day in Istanbul, Sacioglu introduces me to Marie, a refugee from the DR Congo who, if the popular view of trauma held, should expect to endure a life of avoidance and anguish. One night when Marie (whose name has been changed for this article) was 16, a group of militiamen came to her village and killed her mother and her little brother and many of their neighbours and took her into the forest where they held her as a slave. They raped her continuously, every other day, for some weeks, before one of the soldiers took pity on her and led her through the forest to the Rwandan border. From there she found her way to the capital, Kigali, and eventually by plane to Turkey.</p><p>At first she slept on the street, then in a centre run by the Turkish government. She was taken to hospital, where she discovered she was four months pregnant. She regularly hallucinated about her mother, and she had severe PTSD: &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t sleep. I was very scared. I couldn&rsquo;t stay five minutes on my own. I couldn&rsquo;t be in the dark because I would see the soldiers in my mind and all that they did to me. I was afraid of men. In a bus I couldn&rsquo;t be near them. I didn&rsquo;t even want to sit next to a beautiful woman. I&rsquo;d rather sit next to a veiled woman so no one would look at us.&rdquo;</p><p>Marie ended up at Dabatem, where Salcioglu made her confront all the reminders of trauma she was trying to avoid. She encouraged her to sit on buses, to walk in the street, to sleep in the dark. They watched documentaries about rape together. You can see how successful this has been just by looking at her. She walks into the room wearing a white T-shirt and jeans, branded earrings, a showy necklace and gold-plated watch. She has arranged her hair in plaits. Although she avoids eye contact and twists her hands together when she describes what happened, she is no longer trying to hide from life. She has started working in a hair salon.</p><p>Frankl, were he alive, would doubtless approve of this, with his emphasis on doing and creating as a way of discovering meaning in life. Many therapists share his view that surviving trauma is not only about recovery but also about growth. Sometimes great suffering can lead to a transfiguration. &ldquo;For most people, trauma represents an existential crisis,&rdquo; says Stephen Joseph. &ldquo;It wakes them up to the deep questions of life.&rdquo; Once awake to those questions, anything is possible.</p><p><em>Follow us</em> <em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><strong><em>Google+</em></strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><strong><em>LinkedIn</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Take a deep dive into the big stories in science, technology and health written by some of the best writers around.","Name":"In Depth","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"In Depth","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/in-depth","_id":"55dc627e7f6bada044cfc35f"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":[],"CollectionType":"section","Description":"Health","Name":"Health","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"Health"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:44:06.503434Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"00a9a33a-e393-4d09-8029-7e9d5bd1d8cb","Id":"wwfuture/section/health","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T13:52:37.074442Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"section/health"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/section/health","_id":"55dc627b7f6bada044cfc087"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-08-14T10:56:07Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The secrets of extraordinary survivors","HeadlineShort":"The secrets of extreme survivors","HideRelated":false,"Horizontal":null,"Intro":"When faced with trauma, some people manage to emerge stronger than ever.

But all that braised beef would just get lost on me. Fish and chips I avoid: all fried foods taste the same. I&rsquo;m looking at the fish tacos. I know I&rsquo;ll get the spicy heat and a little bit of pineapple flavour, and with the peppers and the guacamole, there&rsquo;ll be some mouthfeel there.&rdquo;</p><p>He orders the tacos, and we get a beer that&rsquo;s on tap. It&rsquo;s called Nugget Nectar, and it&rsquo;s produced by the local craft brewery that Johnson&rsquo;s worked at for the past 10 years. Nugget Nectar used to be his favourite beer. &ldquo;It has a real nice balance of sweetness and hops. But now,&rdquo; he says, and his face falls, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a shell of its former self to me.&rdquo; He can describe what it smells like: &ldquo;piney&rdquo;, &ldquo;citrusy&rdquo;, &ldquo;grapefruity&rdquo;. But he can&rsquo;t smell it any more.</p><blockquote><p> People who can no longer smell report a strong sense of loss </p></blockquote><p>We don&rsquo;t think of ourselves as being particularly good smellers, especially compared with other animals. But research shows that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150803-what-our-perspiration-reveals-about-us\">smells can have a powerful subconscious influence on human thoughts and behaviour</a>. People who can no longer smell &ndash; following an accident or illness &ndash; report a strong sense of loss, with impacts on their lives they could never have imagined. Perhaps we don&rsquo;t rank smell very highly among our senses because it&rsquo;s hard to appreciate what it does for us &ndash; until it&rsquo;s gone.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02z9l2k\"}}</p><p>Johnson, who&rsquo;s 34, can pinpoint the moment he lost his sense of smell. It was 9 January 2014. He was playing ice hockey with friends on the frozen pond at his parents&rsquo; place in Collegeville, Pennsylvania. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it millions of times,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I was skating backwards, slowly, and I hit a rut on the ice. My feet went out from under me. I hit the back right side of my head. I was out. I came to in the ambulance, people surrounding me, blood pouring out of my ear.&rdquo; He had ruptured an eardrum and fractured his skull in three places. He had blood on his brain, and was suffering from seizures. &ldquo;I had no idea what was going on.&rdquo;</p><p>After making a rapid recovery, he was cleared to drive again six weeks later and returned to work as regional sales manager at Troegs brewery. Before long, he found himself in a meeting about a new beer. &ldquo;We were tasting it, and the others were saying, &lsquo;Can you smell the hops in the beer?&rsquo;&hellip; and I couldn&rsquo;t. Then I tasted it. There were guys saying, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s got this pale biscuity flavour&rsquo;&hellip; and I couldn&rsquo;t taste it. Then I went and tried one of the hoppier ones&hellip; and I couldn&rsquo;t smell it. That&rsquo;s when it clicked.&rdquo;</p><p>The stress of the injury and all the medication perhaps explain why he didn&rsquo;t realise he had lost his sense of smell sooner. It came as a shock, he says. Now, though, he is acutely aware of the effects it has had.</p><blockquote><p> More complex flavours &ndash; like grapefruit or barbecued steak &ndash; depend on smell </p></blockquote><p>Losing enjoyment of food and drink is a common complaint for people who lose their sense of smell. You can taste <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150610-the-smells-that-make-sweet-sweeter\">sweet, salty, bitter, sour and umami with your tongue</a>. More complex flavours &ndash; like grapefruit or barbecued steak &ndash; depend on smell. But for Johnson, as for many people who can&rsquo;t smell, there&rsquo;s another category of loss altogether.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02z9hzy\"}}</p><p>At the time of his accident, Johnson&rsquo;s wife was eight months pregnant with their second child. Over lunch, he says: &ldquo;I joke I can&rsquo;t smell my daughter&rsquo;s diaper. But I can&rsquo;t smell my daughter. She was up at 4 o&rsquo;clock this morning. I was holding her, we were laying in bed. I know what my son smelt like as a little baby, as a young kid. Sometimes not so good, but he still had that great little kid smell to him. With her, I&rsquo;ve never experienced that.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>How it happens</strong></p><p>Estimates of just how many people can&rsquo;t smell usually range around a few per cent of adults. That means millions of people living without smell &ndash; some born without it, others who have lost it. Chronic nasal sinus disease is one of the most common causes of loss in younger people. Another risk stems from the fact that our olfactory receptor neurons dangle down into our nostrils, leaving them exposed to damage from environmental toxins and infections.</p><blockquote><p> Even the common cold can cause total loss of smell </p></blockquote><p>In older, but not elderly, people, viral infections are often to blame. Even the common cold can do it, though why it should wipe out smell in some people but not others, no one knows. By the time we get to our 70s and 80s, very few of us will have escaped significant deterioration in our sense of smell. The system has a capacity to regenerate: the nerve cells are dying all the time and being replaced. But as we get older, this process slows, and the patches of nasal tissue without any olfactory receptors get bigger.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02z9j63\"}}<strong></p><p></strong>In Johnson&rsquo;s case, the cause was probably catastrophic damage to his olfactory receptor neurons. Heading from the nose to the brain, these neurons pass through a bony sieve-like structure. When he hit his head on the ice, the sudden movement of his brain inside his skull could have crushed or even cut them against the bone, preventing signals from his nose from reaching his brain.</p><p><strong>How smell works<br /> </strong></p><p>Johnson takes a deep sniff of his glass of Nugget Nectar, the beer that was once his favourite. Volatile chemicals from the liquid are drawn high up into his nostrils, to the roof of his nasal cavity, the part specialised for smelling. Then he takes a sip, and those same chemicals travel up from the back of his mouth to the same part of his nose. So far, so good.</p><blockquote><p> For something to have a smell, its molecules must easily evaporate </p></blockquote><p>Next, the molecules are absorbed into the mucus inside his nose. This is critical for something to be smelly: at the moment, no-one can look at a molecule and say, based solely on its structure, how it will smell, or even whether it will smell at all. All we know is that for something to have a smell, its molecules must easily evaporate so they can be carried in air and inhaled, but they must also dissolve in mucus to be detected.</p><p>For a healthy person sniffing a beer, or their child, or a T-shirt belonging to their partner, exactly what happens next, leading to a perception of the beer or the person as a complex aromatic whole, is only hazily understood. Lurking within the mucus of the nose are the tips of olfactory receptor cells. These nerve cells lead directly to the brain. While we have millions of these cells, there seem to be only about 400 types, each of which binds to a specific molecule (the number is debated; some argue it could be closer to a mere 100). Based on the pattern of activation of the various receptor types, when I sniff Nugget Nectar, I recognise it as &lsquo;beer&rsquo;. Johnson smells nothing &ndash; the impact of his fall probably damaged or even killed his olfactory nerve cells, and his brain receives no information about the smell of his drink.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02z9j46\"}}</p><p>Before his injury, Johnson had a highly sensitive nose. Unlike me, he would have been easily able to distinguish Nugget Nectar from other beers. That ability comes with experience. After the incoming smell signal pattern is processed, this information is sent to different parts of the brain, including regions involved in memory and emotion, as well as to the cortex, where thinking takes place. We can then quickly learn to pair patterns of receptor activation with the source of the smelly molecules.</p><blockquote><p> By one estimate, we can detect more than a trillion smells </p></blockquote><p>Until recently, it was thought humans could detect perhaps only 10,000 different scents. But there&rsquo;s been a radical rethink, according to Joel Mainland, who&rsquo;s researching the fundamentals of smell at the Monell Chemical Senses Center, a world-leading institute for research on smell and taste in Philadelphia. A recent paper in the journal Science estimated that we can detect more than a trillion smells. A few problems have been raised with the methodology of that study and there&rsquo;s still a lot of debate about the true figure, but Mainland certainly thinks that we&rsquo;ve underestimated our abilities.</p><p>Because of the nature of his job, Johnson underwent all kinds of sensory training to improve his smell and taste. The rest of us probably have untapped potential, too. Yes, dogs are renowned for being able to track a person&rsquo;s scent across a field. When Mainland was a PhD student, his supervisor suggested investigating whether humans could be trained to do the same thing. It turned out they could.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02z9j88\"}}</p><p>Dogs have more types of olfactory receptor than we do &ndash; but as Mainland points out, cows have more than dogs (about 1,200 compared with 800) and it&rsquo;s not clear that cows are significantly better at smelling. The poor reputation of humans may be down to the fact that we spend comparatively little time actively sniffing and so training our sense. What difference would it make if we all put more effort into smelling the world around us?</p><p><strong>Emotional state</strong></p><p>One reason to enhance our sense of smell would be to help us better navigate our social world. Some people born without being able to smell may have trouble identifying the emotional states of others, says Mainland. They&rsquo;re aware that while they rely heavily on facial expressions, for example, friends who can smell somehow seem to be picking up on signals they&rsquo;re missing, signals that are so powerful they can override the emotional information contained in a smile or a frown.</p><p>They&rsquo;ll talk about meeting up with a group of friends, Mainland explains, and one friend might say of another: &ldquo;Oh, she wasn&rsquo;t happy at all.&rdquo; And they&rsquo;ll say, &ldquo;She looked happy.&rdquo; And the other will say, &ldquo;Yeah, she looked happy, but she clearly was not happy.&rdquo;</p><p>Researchers have also found that smell can change your mood and behaviour. George Preti at Monell and colleagues have found that extracts of male underarm odours can not only influence female physiology, altering levels of a hormone involved in regulating the menstrual cycle, but also make women feel more relaxed and less tense. And along with Pam Dolton, he has also found evidence that people can detect &ldquo;stressed&rdquo; body odours, often without realising.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150803-what-our-perspiration-reveals-about-us\"><em>Read more about how smell influences how we perceive the emotional state of other people.</em></a><strong><br /> </strong></p><p>So, those with no smell may be missing out on many subtle social signals. Can anything be done for them? There are some effective treatments. If the loss is due to chronic sinus disease, you can treat that condition and reverse the smell loss &ndash; sometimes very rapidly. But for patients like Johnson, there&rsquo;s very little that can be done. He came to Monell to ask the researchers here if they had any advice, and the main recommendation was to actively smell a few different things a couple of times a day, because there&rsquo;s evidence this can help to stimulate the system and may aid recovery.</p><blockquote><p> Researchers recommended to actively smell a few different things a couple of times a day </p></blockquote><p>Things may be different in the future. There is a team at Monell experimenting with nasal stem cells. Right now, they&rsquo;re investigating the most effective ways of converting these stem cells into nerve cells. The hope is that this approach will provide new olfactory receptor neurons for people whose own have been permanently damaged or defective since birth. The team hope to start animal trials in around September 2015, and if those studies go well, to move to people in five to 10 years.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02z9jc3\"}}</p><p>For now, the glimmer of good news for Johnson is that there are some promising signs. Strong-smelling things sometimes do produce a smell sensation, though it&rsquo;s always the same. It used to be an awful burning-oil-type smell, he says. A few months ago, it shifted to something sweeter. This may be a sign that some kind of repair to the system is going on.</p><p>Johnson says he&rsquo;s determined to be positive, and to live life as close as possible to the way it was before the injury. He&rsquo;s gone back to playing ice hockey (though he says, smiling, that he now has the best helmet money can buy).</p><p>He recognises how serious the accident was, but also just how much worse things could have turned out. &ldquo;I had blood on my brain. I could have died. My outlook is: I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not dead. If the loss of my sense of smell is what&rsquo;s happened because of this, I&rsquo;ll take it.&rdquo;</p><p><em>This is an edited version of an article originally published by Mosaic, and is reproduced under a Creative Commons licence.

In the days that followed, investigators began to suspect that co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had deliberately downed the plane &ndash; and when it emerged that Lubitz had a history of depression <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.com/germanwings-plane-crash-should-depressed-pilots-fly-commercial-planes-1862042\" target=\"_blank\">some questioned whether pilots with similar mental conditions should be allowed to fly</a>.</p><p>Time to Change, a campaign to end mental health discrimination run by the charities Mind and Rethink Mental Illness, <a href=\"http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/news/comment-media-reporting-germanwings-plane-crash\" target=\"_blank\">issued a statement</a> urging the public to avoid assuming that all people with depression would act as Lubitz had done. The campaign&rsquo;s own statistics suggest such assumptions might be prevalent: they say that <a href=\"http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/news-media/media-advisory-service/help-journalists/violence-mental-health-problems\" target=\"_blank\">more than one-third of the public </a>believe that people with mental health problems are more likely to be violent.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02xts9l\"}}</p><p>Violent crime statistics tell a different story, though. One survey suggested that only 1% of victims of violent crime believed that the incident occurred because the offender had a mental illness. In the UK, between 50 and 70 cases of homicide a year do involve people known to have a mental health problem at the time of the crime &ndash; but these perpetrators <a href=\"http://www.time-to-change.org.uk/news-media/media-advisory-service/help-journalists/violence-mental-health-problems\" target=\"_blank\">make up a tiny minority</a> of the 7 million people in the UK estimated to have a significant mental illness at any given time.</p><blockquote><p> More than one-third of the public&nbsp;believe people with mental health problems are more likely to be violent </p></blockquote><p>So people with mental illness are very unlikely to commit murder. But what about more everyday violence? One of the most frequently cited studies comes from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study, conducted back in 1998 in the United States. More than 1000 people were followed up every 10 weeks for a year after they left a psychiatric inpatient ward. They were compared with people living in the same neighbourhoods who hadn&rsquo;t been in hospital. Generally speaking there was no difference between the two groups in terms of the levels of violence they perpetrated &ndash; unless drugs or alcohol were involved. Both former patients and other people in the neighbourhoods were more likely to behave violently if they showed signs of substance abuse &ndash;&nbsp;and the <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9596041\" target=\"_blank\">mental health patients</a> were more likely to begin abusing substances than the other people in the community. But mental illness alone was not enough to make people more violent.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02xts81\"}}</p><blockquote><p> Delusional thoughts are not associated with more violence </p></blockquote><p>There are certain mental health diagnoses which are more associated with violence in the minds of the public at large. Psychosis, for example. But again most people with psychosis are not violent. There are cases where people believe that outside forces have control of their minds, and some early studies found that this could lead to an increased risk of violence, but another strand of data from the MacArthur Violence Risk Assessment Study suggests <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10739415/\" target=\"_blank\">these kinds of delusional thoughts are not associated with more violence</a>.</p><p>So if there&rsquo;s no connection, why are there higher than average rates of mental health problems, often untreated, within the prison population? There are many factors at work here. Deprivation puts people at a higher risk of committing crimes, and also at a higher risk of developing mental health issues, so it&rsquo;s hard to disentangle all the factors. And those who have examined the issue in detail point out that the figures <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686644/\" target=\"_blank\">don&rsquo;t prove that mental health problems actually led the offenders in prison to commit their crimes</a>.</p><p>Again, though, substance abuse might be a factor in the prison figures. Research back in 1988 examining arrest rates within a sample of mental health patients found that those with a diagnosis of alcohol or drug abuse <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3338728\" target=\"_blank\">were arrested more times during their adult lives</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02xts62\"}}</p><p>But even if people with mental illness don&rsquo;t generally pose a violent threat to people in the community, what about the violence that staff working in locked wards at mental health units can sometimes encounter? In the United States it&rsquo;s estimated that between 40% and 50% of junior doctors doing stints during their four years of psychiatry training will be assaulted at some point. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> The trigger for attacks may be frustration, not mental illness directly </p></blockquote><p>Some interesting research conducted in the UK found that such assaults &ndash; although frightening for staff &ndash; typically don&rsquo;t come out of the blue. The researchers interviewed nurses and patients within a three-day window following violent incidents and found that in the majority of cases the violence occurred because the nurse asked the patient to do something that they didn&rsquo;t want to do. In other words, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8673027\" target=\"_blank\">the trigger for these attacks may have been frustration</a>, not mental illness alone. The study showed that only a minority of patients behaved aggressively in the absence of aversive triggers. We can't know for sure whether or not a person without a mental health problem would react in the same way to such frustrations since this has not been examined.</p><p>Successful attempts to reduce the numbers of violent incidents suggest they are not the inevitable consequence of illness. Surroundings make a difference too. One study found <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12683268\" target=\"_blank\">more violence when the environment was noisy and unpleasant</a>. And incidents are more common in the evening and early in the morning, so ensuring that there are enough staff available at these times to answer patient questions can help avoid violent incidents.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02xtsfy\"}}</p><p>An intriguing Dutch study involved intervening in one ward for three months and comparing the effects with two control wards where things carried on as usual. All patients in the intervention ward were given detailed explanations of how everything works, why doors are locked, when people can leave, when different staff are available and how to make appointments with psychiatrists. The idea was to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9144826\" target=\"_blank\">lessen as many sources of frustration and uncertainty as possible</a>. The researchers found that the approach did, indeed, lead to a drop in the number of violent incidents on the ward &ndash; but curiously, violent incidents became more infrequent on the other two wards as well. The authors suggest that simply recording incidents can make a difference. Perhaps the study got all the staff thinking about how to avoid the situations that lead to violence in the first place.</p><p>Of course there have been individual cases where people with mental health problems have committed violent crimes. On occasion aspects of the mental illness itself might be a contributing factor: but it&rsquo;s a myth that in general people with mental health problems present any more of a threat than anyone else. <br /> <em><br /> Follow us</em>&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em><strong>Google+</strong></em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a>.<br /> </strong><em><strong><br /> Disclaimer</strong></em><strong><em><br /> </em></strong><em>All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

After boarding their flight in Canada on the evening of 23 August 2001, newlyweds Margaret McKinnon and her husband were heading for Lisbon, Portugal. As Air Transat flight 236 soared over the mid-Atlantic, McKinnon went to the lavatory. Nothing inside it was working. &ldquo;It seemed odd,&rdquo; she says, but she didn't think a lot of it.</p><p>Returning to her seat, the crew served breakfast, but then announced that they would be making an emergency landing. She remembers thinking it seemed early to be arriving in Lisbon. &ldquo;I didn't really understand at the time what that meant,&rdquo; she says. She soon found out. Crew instructed passengers to put on their life jackets. The lights flickered, then extinguished. The cabin depressurised. Oxygen masks deployed.</p><p>The plane&rsquo;s systems had shut down after a catastrophic leakage of fuel. &ldquo;They were shouting that we would be ditching into the ocean,&rdquo; McKinnon recalls.</p><p>After a half hour of preparing for the worst, McKinnon recalls somebody yelling that they&rsquo;d made it to land. It was the Azores, an isolated archipelago some 850 miles (1,360km) off the Portuguese coast. The pilots had established contact with Lajes, a joint military-civilian air base. Following a harrowing 360 degree spin and several sharp turns to reduce altitude, the crew shouted &ldquo;brace, brace, brace&rdquo; as the officers brought the plane to a bumpy landing. Fires licked across the plane&rsquo;s wheels.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgwj\"}}</p><p>The stunned passengers and crew descended escape slides and ran across a field to a safe distance, towards American soldiers with guns. Two serious and 16 minor injuries were sustained during evacuation down the chutes, but all 293 passengers and 13 crew survived.</p><p>But for many the flight didn&rsquo;t end there. For some &ndash; including McKinnon &ndash; the terrifying experience replayed vividly as intrusive memories and nightmares in the months that followed.</p><p>The experience inspired McKinnon, now a clinical psychologist, to study what trauma does to the brain &ndash; how it changes what we remember and why some people experience Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). In recent years, she and a number of other researchers have been trying to understand what makes fearful experiences seem to become imprinted so deeply in our brains. And if they can understand why trauma has such a profound and lasting effect on us, perhaps they can find ways to help people cope better with the aftermath.</p><p><strong>Fearful imprint</strong></p><p>The link between fear and memory has intrigued researchers and clinicians for decades. Yet the data is conflicting. &ldquo;Some studies have found that during the recollection of traumatic events, recollection is enhanced. It's very vivid, people recall many details, and people don't seem to have difficulty remembering,&rdquo; says McKinnon. Other studies have found that recollection of traumatic events can be very impoverished and fragmented, with &ldquo;a detail here, a detail there, that don't really fit together&rdquo;, she explains.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgp8\"}}</p><p>Few studies have looked at memory during the experience of trauma itself, especially for a single, shared event. So McKinnon decided to delve into the memories of her fellow passengers on Air Transat flight 236.</p><p>&ldquo;We wanted to take this opportunity to look at a very &lsquo;controlled&rsquo; circumstance, so to speak,&rdquo; says McKinnon, suppressing an awkward laugh at using &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; to describe AT 236&rsquo;s emergency descent. McKinnon and collaborators examined the memories for 15 passengers on the flight, comparing their recollection of three events: the flight itself, an emotionally neutral event from the same year, and their experience during 9/11, the following month. Six of those interviewed exhibited PTSD symptoms.</p><p>The researchers guided subjects&rsquo; memories by saying &ldquo;tell me everything you can remember about the event&rdquo;, and then further aided retrieval with cues like &ldquo;what were you thinking, what were you feeling, and what was the lighting like in the cabin?&rdquo; These detailed recollections were compared with the known sequence of events, and a control group who had suffered less traumatic memories.</p><p>What they found was that all passengers, regardless of whether they went on to develop PTSD, had vivid and enhanced recollections of the incident, supporting the idea that fear changes how the brain stores memories. In those that subsequently developed PTSD, &ldquo;they showed a lot of recollection of extraneous details, not only of the traumatic event, but also for the events of September 11, as well as from the neutral memory from the same time period&rdquo;, says McKinnon. It suggests that these individuals have difficulty editing what they recollect, or fading the contents of memory.</p><p>McKinnon admits that her study represents a small sample, and is cautious about generalising the results, but they are nevertheless intriguing. &ldquo;Understandably, people were reluctant to participate,&rdquo; says McKinnon. &ldquo;And we are very, very grateful to the people who did participate, because it can be difficult to talk about these kinds of things.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgvy\"}}</p><p>So if traumatic memories are more vivid, what&rsquo;s going on inside our heads when they are &lsquo;made&rsquo;? There are multiple memory systems in the brain. We have physical memories, like how we learn to ride a bike. We have auditory memories for singing songs. And we have more specific &ldquo;declarative&rdquo; memory systems heavily involving the hippocampus. The hippocampus stores memory for things like where we parked our car, and that two plus two is four.</p><p>But fear activates a different system: our body&rsquo;s emergency control centre &ndash; the <a href=\"http://thebrain.mcgill.ca/flash/d/d_04/d_04_cr/d_04_cr_peu/d_04_cr_peu.html\">amygdala</a>. The amygdala, a pair of almond-shaped structures on the left and right of the brain&rsquo;s medial temporal lobe, is particularly involved in emotional memories like fear, but also in pleasurable memories associated with food, sex, or recreational drug use. When a memory is particularly striking and unexpected, it activates this emotional memory system.</p><p>That may be partly why there are a plethora of anecdotes about how sensory cues, out of context, can take you right back to emotional memories &ndash; perhaps you associate the scent of a certain perfume or cologne with your first kiss because the memory is higher fidelity.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgyp\"}}</p><p>With a fearful experience, our survival systems kick into action, and we can achieve what&rsquo;s known as a single trial memory. &ldquo;If you escape from a lion once, or you see someone else being eaten by a lion, you know to be afraid of that lion,&rdquo; explains Kerry Ressler, a professor of psychiatry and behavioural sciences at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia. That's very different from something like studying facts in a book, and activities that aren&rsquo;t emotionally arousing. &ldquo;That may make sense evolutionarily, because we want to prioritise things that are really important,&rdquo; explains Ressler.</p><blockquote><p>The fear system has evolved to keep us alive</p></blockquote><p>When we feel fear, a burst of adrenaline activates a cascade that is thought to enhance memory storage of the immediately preceding events. &ldquo;The fear system has evolved to keep us alive,&rdquo; says Karim Nader, a psychology professor at McGill University in Montreal, Canada.</p><p><strong>Flashbulb memories</p><p></strong>Fearful experiences may not always lay down strong memories, however. Elizabeth Phelps, a professor of psychology and neural science at New York University, was interested in people&rsquo;s so-called &ldquo;flashbulb memories&rdquo; of 9/11. These are not individuals with PTSD, &ldquo;but everyday people who had experienced 9/11, which was most of us&rdquo;, says Phelps. And curiously, she found that, vivid as these memories feel, they were not as strong as people believed &ndash; they could be changed.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jcgy8\"}}</p><p>Phelps&rsquo; lab at NYU was near the thick of the disaster. In a large-scale detailed survey conducted first within a few weeks of 9/11, then one year, two years, and 10 years later, they found that &ldquo;people were very confident that the details of their memory were correct&rdquo;. Not the detail in terms of the fact that it happened, but where they were, who they were with, how they first heard about it, and what they did afterwards. However, personal recollections of the contextual details often actually changed with time.</p><p>This suggests, says Phelps, that flashbulb memories differ from memories of more neutral events not because the details of the memory are preserved any better, but because we think they are. &ldquo;With highly traumatic events we think we have this incredibly accurate memory,&rdquo; she says. The truth is, many of the details we think are accurate are not. &ldquo;Emotion focuses your attention on a few details, at the expense of a lot of others,&rdquo; explains Phelps.</p><p><strong>Total recall</p><p></strong>So, could this mean that <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/05/19/partial-recall\">traumatic memories can be manipulated, even removed</a>? Based on an emerging understanding of the storage and retrieval of memory, we have windows of opportunity for altering the closure of fearful memories in the brain. The time window for dampening the initial locking-in of memories, explains Nader, is on the order of 6 hours. So pharmacological approaches to lessen the strength with which a distressing memory is locked into the brain need to be administered within that short window. Indeed, there is emerging evidence from rodent and human studies that drugs called beta-blockers can achieve a reduction in later PTSD symptoms if administered quickly. &ldquo;The Israeli military now use that,&rdquo; says Nader. But new research is suggesting that even beyond the short window during which memories are saved to the internal hard drive of our brain, they can be retrieved, updated, and toned down.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jchfv\"}}</p><p>Experimenting with rats, Nader reminded animals of a conditioned fearful memory with a musical tone (previously linked to an electric shock), and subsequently administered a beta-blocker. Even after the beta-blocker was eliminated from the blood, the fearful freezing response to the memory was gone. Exploring the same approach in a small sample of humans, Nader and colleagues determined that despite an average of 11 years between trauma and experimental intervention, &ldquo;even after the beta-blocker was eliminated from the blood, their trauma was down to non-PTSD levels&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s still early days for this method, and studies of its efficacy are ongoing.</p><p>Still, by using what we know about reconsolidation as a potential therapeutic tool, it seems that a subtle form of memory reprogramming is within reach. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not changing your knowledge of what happened. We&rsquo;re just changing its association with these fight or flight stress responses that we get&rdquo;, says Phelps. &ldquo;So the notion that we&rsquo;re going to be able to erase your knowledge of what happened &ndash; that&rsquo;s science fiction at this point.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Departure points</p><p></strong>As for McKinnon, she admits that despite her vividly traumatic experience, there are many details she can&rsquo;t remember.</p><p>&ldquo;We were over the top of the island and then the plane veered back over the ocean, which was incredibly scary, because then we thought &lsquo;that was it&rsquo;,&rdquo; says McKinnon, recalling the moment that AT 236 approached the Lajes landing strip. She remembers seeing the tops of houses, and worrying about crashing there and killing other people. But asked if the plane was in darkness during its terrifying descent, McKinnon says, &ldquo;I have to be honest with you &ndash; I entirely don't remember.&rdquo; Nor can she remember whether or not she was sitting beside the window.</p><p>When it comes to terrifying memories, perhaps our brains are selective in what details are stored. The more we learn about how and why, the closer we&rsquo;ll get to lessening the impact of trauma.</p><p>That fated honeymoon flight was an eventful way to begin a marriage. &ldquo;It was quite a start, yes,&rdquo; McKinnon laughs. &ldquo;Unexpected.&rdquo; It proved to be a life-changing year in more than one way: making her aware of the need for research, but also for better care and treatment for PTSD, she says. &ldquo;And that was the direction I wanted to take my career in.&rdquo; McKinnon&rsquo;s experience that day was the start of an unforeseen new personal and scientific journey. As time goes by, the memory may be harder to remember, but the legacy is hard to forget.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-06T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"How extreme fear shapes what we remember","HeadlineShort":"How extreme fear shapes the brain","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Many of us will experience a significant trauma in our lives, says Lesley Evans Ogden.

In a 2006 interview, Robin Williams talked openly about his mood swings. <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/11/robin-williams-mental-illness_n_5670367.html?1407812868\">&ldquo;Do I perform sometimes in a manic style? Yes. Am I manic all the time? No. Do I get sad? Oh yeah. Does it hit me hard? Oh yeah.&rdquo;</a> He didn&rsquo;t say that he&rsquo;d been clinically diagnosed with a specific disorder, but his publicist has confirmed that Williams had been battling depression in the months leading up to his suicide.</p><p>Among the hundreds of tributes to Williams&rsquo; warmth and comic genius, many have pointed out that his death highlights, yet again, the many misconceptions and stigmas surrounding mental health problems. NBC News has a thoughtful piece about the <a href=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/robin-williams-death/deadly-stigma-robin-williams-suicide-exposes-silent-epidemic-n179206\">&ldquo;deadly stigma&rdquo; surrounding this &ldquo;silent epidemic&rdquo;</a> &ndash; suicide is rarely discussed, despite the fact that it is a growing issue; more people in the United States now die of suicide than in automobile accidents. Then there are people who still consider suicide a <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2014/aug/12/robin-williams-suicide-and-depression-are-not-selfish\">&ldquo;selfish act&rdquo; that can be cured with willpower</a>. It is sad we are even having these discussions. Tony Blair&rsquo;s former spin doctor, Alistair Campbell, who has himself suffered from mental health problems, best described the misunderstandings in an article for the Guardian: &ldquo;If he&rsquo;d had a heart attack, lost a fight with cancer or been knocked over by a car, would there be a need for a debate about what this says about the state of heart disease, or cancer care or road safety?&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p024s0zy\"}}</p><p>Yet even once the taboos have been broken, we still have a long way to go if we are to treat suicidal feelings with the same precision as other diseases. Anti-depressant drugs and cognitive behavioural therapy seem to <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jad.2014.05.036\">reduce suicidal thoughts for many people with depression</a> &ndash; but they are not a perfect cure for every patient. Why some respond, while others don&rsquo;t, has been the matter of much soul searching, but recent research is helping to shed a little light on this dark state of mind.<br /><strong><br />Self-awareness</strong></p><p>For instance, there is a growing recognition that the disease we call &ldquo;depression&rdquo; could be an umbrella-term covering many distinct problems, each with a different biological origin. In particular, a suicide attempt may be foreshadowed by a string of neurological changes that are not found in people with other kinds of depression.&nbsp; Of the most noticeable differences, patients who have tried to kill themselves seem to have less <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002239561400003X\">&nbsp;of the white-matter connections that transmit information in the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex</a> &nbsp;&ndash; the part of the brain right behind your forehead&rsquo;s hairline. That&rsquo;s significant, since this region helps us process our self-awareness.</p><p>People who try to kill themselves seem to get stuck in ruminative, negative styles of thinking full of self-criticism &ndash; so the study&rsquo;s authors wonder if the neurological changes could lie behind those destructive trains of thought, blinding people to the hope and promise of the future, and even of their sense&nbsp; of their own self-worth.</p><p>People feeling suicidal thoughts also seem to have reduced connectivity in the frontal areas of the brain associated with <a href=\"http://cercor.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/252.long\">emotional control and inhibition</a>. Again, the consequences of this are hypothetical, but suicide is considered to be an <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3319758/\">impulsive action</a>, so it could be that the abnormal wiring in these regions makes it harder for someone to cope with the urge for self-destruction. On top of these specific changes, the brain cells themselves <a href=\"http://psycontent.metapress.com/content/r534057025w880j7/fulltext.pdf\">seem to be wasting away across diverse regions of the brain</a>, potentially impairing problem solving and decision making &ndash; cognitive problems that are commonly seen in people who have attempted suicide.</p><p>At the moment, it&rsquo;s not clear what triggers these anatomical changes and whether they are the primary cause of the suicidal urges &ndash; it could be that they are just a side-effect of the depressed, desperate feelings that the patient is already experiencing. Most likely, the psychological symptoms and the altered brain wiring are both the result of a complex interplay between your genes and your circumstances.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p024s1ty\"}}</p><p>Once we have picked apart the specific mechanism, this new understanding could eventually change the way we treat people with depression. Firstly, it could help identify who is most at risk for suicidal tendencies. Many suicidal patients are unlikely to tell anyone, even their doctors, about their darkest feelings &ndash; but a brain scan might reveal those characteristic anatomical changes, giving doctors an insight that they couldn&rsquo;t have gained from an interview. Since neural degeneration &ndash; such as the death of neurons &ndash; has certain chemical signatures, some have suggested that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23958961\">blood tests could one day reveal the early signs that could precede a suicide attempt</a>. <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25073599\">Preliminary explorations of the technique have been positive</a>, but much larger trials will be needed before any form of this test could be used in the clinic.</p><p>Once the patients&rsquo; particular needs have been identified, the work could then tailor treatments that best suit the particular type of depression they have. Doses of lithium, for instance, seem to replenish the grey matter in damaged areas of the suicidal brain; and studies have found that the drugs do indeed <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.pharmtox.011008.145557\">reduce the risk of a second suicide attempt</a>, when applied to people with bipolar disorder who have already attempted to take their life once. Other drugs could have a similar function. <br /><strong><br />New options</strong></p><p>Kees van Heeringen at the Unit for Suicide Research in Ghent University in Belgium has proposed that upcoming, non-invasive forms of brain stimulation like <a href=\"http://psycontent.metapress.com/content/r534057025w880j7/fulltext.pdf\">transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) could also be of interest</a>. Using a magnet on the scalp, TMS can boost or reduce the electrical activity in specific parts of the brain &ndash; sometimes with long-lasting effects. It has already helped <a href=\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/804736\">bring relief to people with other kinds of depression that had resisted treatment</a>, and it could potentially target the regions most affected in people with suicidal feelings, curtailing their destructive urges. A better understanding of the brain changes involved &ndash; and the way it influences someone&rsquo;s thinking &ndash; may even help refine the talking therapies by helping to identify the thought processes that are most severely disrupted as a consequence, says van Heeringen.</p><p>It is unlikely that any single treatment will ever be a panacea for people suffering from severe and suicidal depression. Instead, the strength of this new approach lies in the many different strands; where there was once a murky darkness, neuroscientists and psychiatrists are now beginning to see a kaleidoscope of new options. If they can be adapted to each patient&rsquo;s specific circumstances, that might save an enormous number of lives from being needlessly taken from the world.</p><p>If you feel suicidal yourself, or know someone who might be, the advice is to seek medical help as soon as possible.

To illustrate his point, he compares it to a Broadway show. In front of the stage, he says, the audience are transported by the drama. Look behind the scenes, however, and you will find the technical engineers, focusing on analysing the technicalities of the event.</p><blockquote><p> People with the condition call themselves &#x201C;alexes&#x201D; </p></blockquote><p>Despite taking centre stage at the ceremony, he felt similarly detached from the tides of emotion swelling up in the people around him. &#x201C;For me, it was a mechanical production,&#x201D; says Caleb (who asked us not to use his full name). Even as his wife walked down the aisle, the only sensation he felt was his face flushing and a heaviness in his feet; his mind was completely clear of joy, happiness, or love in its conventional sense.</p><p>In fact, Caleb claims not to feel almost any emotions &#x2013; good, or bad. I meet him through an <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/exchange-forum">internet forum for people with &#x201C;alexithymia&#x201D;</a> &#x2013; a kind of emotional &#x201C;colour-blindness&#x201D; that prevents them from perceiving or expressing the many shades of feeling that normally embellish our lives. The condition is found in around 50% of people with autism, but many &#x201C;alexes&#x201D; (as they call themselves) such as Cal&#xAD;&#xAD;&#xAD;eb do not show any other autistic traits such as compulsive or repetitive behaviour.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: Getty Images)" data-caption="When you struggle to feel any emotions yourself, others&apos; behaviour can seem alien to you (Credit: Getty Images)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: Getty Images)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/30/26/p030263b.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: Getty Images) </a></div></p><blockquote><p> What does it mean to fall in love, when you lack the capacity to feel affection? </p></blockquote><p>Getting to the bottom of this emotional blindness could shed light on many serious illnesses, from anorexia and schizophrenia to chronic pain and irritable bowel syndrome. More personally, stories from the &#x201C;alex community&#x201D; lead you to re-examine experiences that you might think you know so well. How can you fall in love, for example, when you lack all the basic tender feelings of affection that normally spark a romance?</p><p><strong>Shells of feeling</strong></p><p>To understand that emotional numbness, it helps to imagine emotions as a kind of Russian doll, formed of different shells, each one becoming more intricate. At the heart is a bodily sensation &#x2013; the skip in your heart when you see the person you love, or the churning stomach that comes with anger. The brain may then attach a value to those feelings &#x2013; you know if it is good or bad, and if that feeling is strong, or weak; the amorphous sensations begin to take a shape and form a conscious representation of an emotion. The feelings can be nuanced, perhaps blending different types of emotions, such as bitter-sweet sorrow, and eventually we attach words to them &#x2013; you can describe your despair, or your joy, and you can explain how you came to feel that way.</p><p>When alexithymia was first described in 1972, the problem was thought to centre on this last, linguistic stage: deep down people with alexithymia felt the same as everyone else, but they just couldn&#x2019;t put the emotions into words. The scientists hypothesised that this may result from a <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0890856709632342">breakdown in communication between the two hemispheres</a>, preventing signals from the emotional regions, predominantly in the right, from reaching the language areas, predominantly in the left. &#x201C;You need that emotional transfer in order to verbalise what you&#x2019;re feeling,&#x201D; says Katharina Goerlich-Dobre at RWTH Aachen University. This could be seen, most dramatically, when surgeons tried to cure epilepsy by cutting the fibres that connect the two hemispheres; although it reduced the seizures, the patients also appeared emotionally mute as a result. Less sensationally, Goerlich-Dobre&#x2019;s brain scans have found that other people with alexithymia seem to have <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26094609">abnormally dense connections in that neural bridge</a>. This might create a noisy signal (a bit like a badly tuned radio) that prevents emotional cross-talk, she thinks.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: Science Photo Library)" data-caption="When surgeons cut the dense connections between the two hemispheres, patients become emotionally mute and unable to express their feelings (Credit: Science Photo Library)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: Science Photo Library)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/30/27/p030274k.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: Science Photo Library) </a></div></p><p>Today, it seems clear that there may be many types of alexithymia. While some might have trouble expressing emotions, others (like Caleb) might not even be conscious of the feelings in the first place. Richard Lane, at the University of Arizona compares it to people who have gone blind after damage to the visual cortex; despite having healthy eyes, they can&#x2019;t see the images. In the same way, a damaged neural circuit involved in emotional processing might prevent <a href="http://www.biologicalpsychiatryjournal.com/article/S0006-3223%2897%2900050-4/abstract">sadness</a>, happiness or anger from bursting into consciousness. (Using the analogy of the Russian doll, their emotions are breaking down at the second shell of feeling &#x2013; their bodies are reacting normally, but the sensations don&#x2019;t merge to form an emotional thought or feeling.) &#x201C;Maybe the emotion gets activated, you even have the bodily responses, but it happens without you being consciously aware of the emotion,&#x201D; he says.</p><p>Along these lines, a few recent fMRI scanning studies have found signs of a more basic perceptual problem in some types of alexithymia. Goerlich-Dobre, for instance, found reduced <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.22879/abstract">grey matter in areas of the cingulate cortex serving self-awareness</a>, potentially blocking a conscious representation of the emotions. And Andr&#xE9; Aleman at the University Medical Centre in Groningen, the Netherlands, detected <a href="http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/04/23/scan.nsu056">some deficits in areas associated with attention</a> when alexithymics look at emotionally charged-pictures; it was as if their brains just weren&#x2019;t registering the feelings. &#x201C;I think this fits quite well with [Lane&#x2019;s] theory,&#x201D; says Aleman &#x2013; who had initially suspected other causes. &#x201C;We have to admit they are right.&#x201D;</p><blockquote><p> The more extreme the emotion I should be feeling, the more it should be colouring how I&#x2019;m thinking. In reality I have a clearer head, I become more analytical &#x2013; Caleb </p></blockquote><p>Caleb himself describes a &#x201C;conscious disconnect&#x201D; that prevents emotions from breaking through into his mind. For instance, one day at school he was working with the student theatre. All week he had been struggling to produce the right sound effects, but it just wasn&#x2019;t coming together. Eventually, his boss lost his cool and started ripping into him. &#x201C;My response was that something weird was happening with my body,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;I could feel a tension, like my heart was racing, but my mind was distracted&#x2026; It was an academic curiosity, and then I completely forgot about the whole situation,&#x201D; he says. It seems that almost no event can penetrate that indifference. &#x201C;The more extreme the emotion I should be feeling, the more it should be colouring how I&#x2019;m thinking. In reality I end up having a clearer head &#x2013; I become more analytical.&#x201D;</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: Science Photo Library)" data-caption="Contrary to the stereotype, autistic people do not all suffer emotional or social difficulties (Credit: Science Photo Library)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: Science Photo Library)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/30/27/p03027mj.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: Science Photo Library) </a></div></p><blockquote><p> I can put up with unpleasant experiences because I know I won&#x2019;t have memory associated with it &#x2013; Caleb </p></blockquote><p>There is one, slim advantage: he finds it easier to cope with medical procedures, since he doesn&#x2019;t attach the fear, sadness or anxiety to it. &#x201C;I can put up with an awful lot of pain or unpleasant experiences because I know very shortly I won&#x2019;t have an emotional memory associated with it,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;But it means that positive memories get washed away too.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Neural short circuit</strong></p><p>It is a small pay-off, however: alexithymia seems to be linked to various other illnesses, including schizophrenia and eating disorders, perhaps because emotions normally guide us to take better care of our physical and mental health. Better defining alexithymia could therefore offer insights into these disorders. It could also give us a more nuanced understanding of autism. Despite the stereotypes, <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/geoffbirdlab/home">Geoffrey Bird</a> at Kings College London points out that around half of autistic people are perfectly capable of perceiving and responding to others, and those with social problems tend to also be suffering from alexithymia. For this reason, he thinks that distinguishing the two, distinct, disorders could therefore lead to better guidance. At the moment, misunderstandings can often stand in the way of some autistic people getting the help they need. &#x201C;One autistic adult I worked with wanted to be a carer, but she was told &#x2018;you don&#x2019;t have empathy so can&#x2019;t have the job&#x2019;,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;Our research shows that lots of people with autism are fully okay with emotions.&#x201D;</p><blockquote><p> They are hypersensitive to bodily perceptions, and not able to focus on anything else, which might be one reason why they develop chronic pain </p></blockquote><p>Further work could also pin down the puzzling link to so-called &#x201C;somatic disorders&#x201D;, such as chronic pain and irritable bowel syndrome, that seem to be unusually common in people with alexithymia. Lane suggests it&#x2019;s down to a kind of &#x201C;short-circuit&#x201D; in the brain, created by the emotional blindness. Normally, he says, the conscious perception of emotions can help damp down the physical sensations associated with the feeling. &#x201C;If you can consciously process and allow the feeling to evolve &#x2013; if you engage the frontal areas of the brain, you recruit mechanisms that have a top down, modulatory effect on bodily processes,&#x201D; says Lane. Without the emotional outlet, however, the mind could get stuck on the physical feelings, potentially amplifying the responses. As Goerlich-Dobre puts it: &#x201C;They are hypersensitive to bodily perceptions, and not able to focus on anything else, which might be one reason why they develop chronic pain.&#x201D; (Some studies, have in fact found that <a href="http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1751-0759-7-1.pdf">alexes are often abnormally sensitive to bodily sensations</a>, although <a href="http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J094v13n03_05#preview">other experiments have found conflicting evidence</a>.)</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: Getty Images)" data-caption="People with alexithymia often travel a lonely road as they try to connect to their emotions (Credit: Getty Images)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: Getty Images)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/30/27/p03027bj.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: Getty Images) </a></div></p><p>Physical sensations certainly seem to dominate Caleb&#x2019;s descriptions of difficult events, such as periods of separation from his family. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t miss people, as far as I can tell. If I&#x2019;m gone, and don&#x2019;t see someone for a long period, it&#x2019;s a case of out of sight, out of mind,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;But I do feel physically a kind of pressure or stress when I&#x2019;m not around my wife or my child for a couple of days.&#x201D;</p><p><strong>Reconnecting to lost feelings</strong></p><p>The hope is that eventually, doctors may be able to track down the origins of alexithymia and stop the effects from snow-balling. Caleb thinks his alexithymia emerged at birth and could be genetic. Upbringing &#x2013; and the emotional fluency of your parents &#x2013; may also play a role, while for others, it may be caused by trauma that shuts down people&#x2019;s ability to process some or all of their emotions.</p><p>Lane, for instance, introduced me to one of his patients, Patrick Dust, who was the subject of violent abuse from his alcoholic father &#x2013; experiences that put his life in danger. &#x201C;One night, when he came home, my mother and he had another intense verbal argument. He said &apos;I&#x2019;m going to get my shotgun and kill all of you&apos;&#x2026; We ran to a neighbour&#x2019;s house where we called the police.&#x201D; For decades afterwards, he found it difficult to interpret and understand his emotions, particularly the fear and the anger he still felt towards his parents. He suspects this resulted in his fibromyalgia &#x2013; chronic diffuse pain and tenderness across the whole body &#x2013; and an eating disorder.</p><blockquote><p> I discovered the tremendous anger I had felt, without much awareness of it. It&#x2019;s the most important thing I&#x2019;ve done in my life &#x2013; Patrick Dust </p></blockquote><p>With initial guidance from Lane and later by himself, Dust was able to revisit the past and reconnect to the emotions he was locking away, which he thinks also brought some relief to the fibromyalgia. &#x201C;I discovered the tremendous anger I had felt, without much awareness of it,&#x201D; he explains. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s the most important thing I&#x2019;ve done in my life.&#x201D; He has just finished writing a book about the process.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: Getty Images)" data-caption="By making a conscious effort to love, alexithymic people may offer stability in a relationship (Credit: Getty Images)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: Getty Images)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/30/27/p03027ws.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: Getty Images) </a></div></p><p>Caleb, too, has visited a cognitive behavioural therapist to help with his social understanding, and through conscious effort he is now better able to analyse the physical feelings and to equate it with emotions that other people may feel. Although it remains a somewhat academic exercise, the process helps him to try to grasp his wife&#x2019;s feelings and to see why she acts the way she does.</p><p>Not everyone with alexithymia may have his determination and patience, however. Nor may they find a life partner who is willing to make the allowances his condition requires. &#x201C;It takes a lot of understanding on my wife&#x2019;s part&#x2026; She understands that my conceptions of things like love are a bit different,&#x201D; he says. In return, she may benefit from his stability &#x2013; he is not swayed by the fickle tides of feelings. &#x201C;The trade-off is that my relationship with my wife is a conscious choice,&#x201D; he says &#x2013; he is not acting on a whim but a very deliberate decision to care for her. That has been particularly helpful in the last eight months. &#x201C;It means that if we&#x2019;re going through a difficult situation &#x2013; if the kid&#x2019;s up all night crying &#x2013; for me that doesn&#x2019;t affect our relationship at all, because the connection isn&#x2019;t built on emotion,&#x201D; says Caleb.</p><p>Caleb may not have been transported to ecstasy by his wedding or the birth of his child, but he has spent most of his life looking within, striving to feel and understand the sensations of himself and the people around him. The result is that he is certainly one of the most thoughtful, and self-aware, people I have ever had the pleasure of interviewing &#x2013; someone who seems to know himself, and his limitations, inside out.</p><p>Ultimately, he wants to emphasise that emotional blindness does not make one unkind, or selfish. &#x201C;It may be hard to believe, but it is possible for someone to be cut off completely from the emotions and imagination that are such a big part of what makes us humans,&#x201D; he says. &#x201C;And that a person can be cut off from emotions without being heartless, or a psychopath.&#x201D;</p><p><em>David Robson is BBC Future&#x2019;s feature writer.
