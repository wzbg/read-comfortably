A brainy math kid out of Buffalo who earned an engineering degree at MIT, she hit California like a meteor, working for Apple, General Magic, and Google. Then Todd Park, the United State chief technical officer and advisor to the President, called, asking her to take his job. She said yes.</p><p name="9473" id="9473" class="graf--p">Around the same time another Silicon Valley lifer, Alex Macgillivray (known widely as AMac) got a similar call from Park. Macgillivray had been a top policy attorney at Google and general counsel of Twitter. Park was tapping him to become Smith&#x2019;s deputy CTO, and he also agreed.</p><p name="93ad" id="93ad" class="graf--p">The duo, on the job almost a year now, have presided over the White House tech policy operation, situated within the Office of Science and Technology Policy, at a time when President Obama seems to finally be getting his geek on. It is probably no coincidence that in the aftermath of the healthcare.gov debacle &#x2014; and the subsequent triumphant rescue by a cadre of Silicon Valley veterans of Google and other companies &#x2014; that the chief executive is speaking forcefully and frequently about utilizing the energy of our nation&#x2019;s tech talent to make government more efficient. He has also been more present in speaking up for some of his long-held tech-friendly policy issues, like net neutrality.</p><p name="35be" id="35be" class="graf--p">Smith and Macgillivray are taking advantage of the gov-tech moment to involve the White House in a number of projects, including the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/05/18/launching-police-data-initiative" data-href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2015/05/18/launching-police-data-initiative" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Police Data Initiative</a> (compiling information from cooperating local departments on things like who gets detained, and what happens with bodycams) and <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/technology/techhire" data-href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/issues/technology/techhire" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">TechHire </a>(to open up technical jobs to a diverse population). Smith has been at the President&#x2019;s side at a number of events familiar to Californians but previously rare on Pennsylvania Avenue, like meetups, tech fairs and demo days.</p><p name="681b" id="681b" class="graf--p">Earlier this month, Smith and Macgillivray sat down with Backchannel in a conference room near their warren of desks in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. The interview is edited for brevity and clarity.</p><p name="0fe3" id="0fe3" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Megan, you&#x2019;ve been in this post almost a year after a long career in Silicon Valley. What&#x2019;s it like?</strong></p><p name="e66a" id="e66a" class="graf--p">MEGAN SMITH: It&#x2019;s an amazing time. We were there at the beginning of the Internet and I remember what it felt like around &#x2018;97-&#x2018;98. All these ideas that we had for a long time were finally starting to execute, [as opposed to] rolling the rock up the hill. And what&#x2019;s happening [now] is very much the beginning of digital government. It&#x2019;s also about governments actually having tech people in the principal seats.</p><p name="0d62" id="0d62" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I&#x2019;ve followed the Obama White House tech initiative closely, and the high expectations from the tech world were not initially met. But in the last year or so &#x2014; maybe since the healthcare.gov turnaround &#x2014; there&#x2019;s been a lot of momentum, big hires and high-profile efforts. Why is the government tech renaissance underway now when it wasn&#x2019;t in 2009?</strong></p><p name="7098" id="7098" class="graf--p">ALEX MACGILLIVRAY: You needed to have some tilling of the land, to have some seeds planted. Part of it is that there are nice models outside [the US] &#x2014; like Estonia and the UK. So we can look to some stuff that&#x2019;s outside. You also have Mikey [Dickerson, head of the United States Digital Services], who has been here now for a while and knows stuff about how to get things done within government. When he first arrived it wasn&#x2019;t like the skies parted and the angels sang. It was hard work. But now it&#x2019;s getting easier and easier.</p><p name="f1cd" id="f1cd" class="graf--p">MS: The President was open to it. And then came the heathcare.gov website. Here&#x2019;s this great policy that gets through Congress. It&#x2019;s a brilliant business model, it has all these pieces to it&#x2026;and a <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">website</em> is going to mess it up? Even once they fixed it, the website still took seventy pages to click through [and complete enrollment]. If you had to go through seventy pages to buy something at Amazon, would you do it? In the next wave, the team fixed that. The President witnessed something that he hadn&#x2019;t seen. He knew the techies, was familiar, had had them in the campaign, but really hadn&#x2019;t seen how the sausage is made. So seeing people do daily stand ups, working the way that techies do, I think he&#x2019;s like &#x201C;Okay, we&#x2019;re missing these people, let&#x2019;s change this.&#x201D;</p><p name="5e40" id="5e40" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I want to ask each of you, was it a tough decision to come here?</strong></p><p name="afb7" id="afb7" class="graf--p">AM: A no-brainer. I think we both had a couple hours to make the decision.</p><p name="05ab" id="05ab" class="graf--p">MS: At first I got this email from Todd Park. At first I was, like, &#x201C;What? Move to Washington?&#x201D; But when he described the job, it was an amazing thing.</p><p name="12eb" id="12eb" class="graf--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What was amazing about it?</strong></p><p name="2d10" id="2d10" class="graf--p">MS: This ability to really serve the American people. I realize now there&#x2019;s two things we techies should do &#x2014; one is go where there are lots of us, like MIT or Silicon Valley or whatever, because you can move really fast and do extraordinary things. The other is, go where you&#x2019;re rare. People here are incredibly entrepreneurial, they are incredibly mission driven, they are really talented. They&#x2019;re really good at economics, they&#x2019;re really good at speech writing, they are really amazing at legislation. They&#x2019;re not as technical as us. There is literally a seat missing of the technical person at the table and we need to add that. And so we need to show up.

Then there&#x2019;s a hundred other things. The President can have people to the Oval Office. That&#x2019;s a great thing. The President has the @Potus [Twitter] account, right?

Thirty percent of the people graduate from high school. Seventy percent unemployment. Just not good. So we went, and there&#x2019;s lots of things that we could be doing there as team CTO. For example, there&#x2019;s less than ten percent Internet connectivity there. So if you actually add some TQ, you could go have a meeting with the Telco carrier for Pine Ridge and find out that they actually have fiber. But the schools are structured in a way that they&#x2019;re not talking to this other person or the health service is not talking to those folks. But we can fix this stuff. Just taking a connectivity engineer, which we had someone volunteer to go with us, was like night and day on understanding how to debug this problem.
