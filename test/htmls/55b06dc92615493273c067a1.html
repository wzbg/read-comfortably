href="http://time.com/3594548/using-instagram-to-open-a-window-on-everyday-life-in-north-korea/">a peek inside</a> North Korea. However, the nation remains a mysterious place, where propaganda and reality coexist. This intertwined dichotomy fascinated Dutch photographer Alice Wielinga, who produced a series of photomontages that mesh the reality of what she personally saw when visiting North Korea with the utopian vision of its leaders.</p> <p>Wielinga started her career as a photojournalist in 2004 after graduating from the Academy of Arts in St. Joost in the Netherlands. But, after four years spent in the editorial market, she became increasingly disillusioned by it. &#x201C;Every time I sent a picture to the desks, they were happy but I wasn&#x2019;t,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;I felt that, with mere documenting, I wasn&#x2019;t able to tell the story as I felt it, as I was experiencing it.&#x201D;</p> <p>That&#x2019;s when she turned to photomontage. &#x201C;That way, I could use my documentary pictures and combine them with other works to go further,&#x201D; she says.</p> <p>That ability to tell a story the way she experienced it proved handy after the photographer got a chance to visit North Korea through an organized tour in 2013.</p> <p>&#x201C;I want to recreate images that look like theirs but that tell my own story,&#x201D; the 33-year-old says. &#x201C;When I arrived in North Korea, I noticed that what I interpreted as the reality of North Korea was also a version of propaganda. Through the documentaries I&#x2019;ve seen, the books I&#x2019;ve bought, I had this image of North Korea as a country that stood still for 50 years, which is true, but that&#x2019;s a version that they try to show you on these propaganda tours.&#x201D;</p><div class="content-ad" id="content-ad-3964754"></div> <p>She cites the example of an English class she was allowed to attend. &#x201C;When I saw it, I realized that I had seen this exact English class in a documentary,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;That&#x2019;s when you realize that this is not the everyday reality of North Korea. It&#x2019;s a very polished version of everyday reality.&#x201D;</p> <p>Photomontage allows Wielinga to combine the polished version with what lies underneath. Her composite images take between one and three weeks to produce, and are often made up of dozens of images meshed together with one, two or three paintings or propaganda pictures. &#x201C;First I collect the materials, and then I collect hundreds of paintings from books, but also from photographs I took in art galleries in North Korea,&#x201D; she says. &#x201C;Then, I scatter the prints on the floor of my studio and I start looking for things that are linked to each other or confront one another.&#x201D;</p> <p>While Wielinga tried to imagine what North Koreans actually feel like, she admits that her images are interpretations of what she felt while visiting the secluded country. &#x201C;I think there&#x2019;s a part of North Korea that truly hopes it&#x2019;s building that utopia, but they also realize that they are actually far from it.&#x201D;</p> <p><em><a href="http://www.alicewielinga.nl/" target="_blank"><strong>Alice Wielinga</strong></a> is a Dutch photographer.

Through the documentaries I&rsquo;ve seen, the books I&rsquo;ve bought, I had this image of North Korea as a country that stood still for 50 years, which is true, but that&rsquo;s a version that they try to show you on these propaganda tours.&rdquo;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3964754\"><\/div>\n<p>She cites the example of an English class she was allowed to attend. &ldquo;When I saw it, I realized that I had seen this exact English class in a documentary,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s when you realize that this is not the everyday reality of North Korea. It&rsquo;s a very polished version of everyday reality.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Photomontage allows Wielinga to combine the polished version with what lies underneath. Her composite images take between one and three weeks to produce, and are often made up of dozens of images meshed together with one, two or three paintings or propaganda pictures. &ldquo;First I collect the materials, and then I collect hundreds of paintings from books, but also from photographs I took in art galleries in North Korea,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Then, I scatter the prints on the floor of my studio and I start looking for things that are linked to each other or confront one another.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>While Wielinga tried to imagine what North Koreans actually feel like, she admits that her images are interpretations of what she felt while visiting the secluded country. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a part of North Korea that truly hopes it&rsquo;s building that utopia, but they also realize that they are actually far from it.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.alicewielinga.nl\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Alice Wielinga<\/strong><\/a> is a Dutch photographer.

bomb blasts shrapnel across the faces of wounded men; Chinese soldiers run victorious toward the front line; a hostage lies on the ground with a noose around his neck. While these scenes often play out on a large screen before thousands of viewers over handfuls of popcorn, the lesser-known scenes are the ones in between: makeup artists touch up fake war wounds; film crews bark orders; a bloody soldier yawns before the camera rolls &mdash; these moments, captured by Getty Images photographer Kevin Frayer, convey a fierce Chinese patriotism.<\/p>\n<p>The six productions are part of hundreds of war-themed films, documentaries and performances releasing this month in celebration of the Second World War&rsquo;s 70th anniversary. While the holiday gives sway to China&rsquo;s World War II moviedom, the trend is not new. &ldquo;You spend a day in this country and chances are you&#8217;ve seen one of these on a television set in a hotel room, somebody&#8217;s living room, in the window of a shop or while you&#8217;re eating noodles in a restaurant,&rdquo; Frayer says.<\/p>\n<p>The films, which depict Chinese communist-led forces as self-glorified victors over the oppressive enemy, have been recently labeled by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ibtimes.co.uk\/china-behind-scenes-second-world-war-anti-japanese-propaganda-tv-series-1516025\" target=\"_blank\">International Business Times<\/a> as propaganda. Following the invasion of Japan during the 1930s, China was subject to harsh colonial rule. Seven decades later, Japan&rsquo;s purported refusal to acknowledge its imperial past has led to strained relations between the neighboring countries.<\/p>\n<p>For Frayer, the movies are not as much anti-Japanese as they are nationalistic. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t think these films glamorize war any more than the ones we make in Western countries, marking our wartime victories over the Germans or the Japanese in the Second World War,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a substantial part of their history, so they are marking the 70th anniversary just like everybody else.&rdquo;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4008994\"><\/div>\n<p>Frayer&rsquo;s photos portray a certain human element rarely seen on screen: a cameraman reacts in elation to a successful action scene; an extra smokes a cigarette on props after an outtake. &ldquo;You see these Chinese actors come from outer cities to get blown up on screen and die as Japanese soldiers for the equivalent of 10 U.S. dollars a day,&rdquo; Frayer says. &ldquo;And then in between takes, they are sitting there on their smartphones like everyone else.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Filmed at Hengdian World Studios in eastern China, Frayer captures the over-the-top pyrotechnic stunts and special effects of these high-end productions, which are put on by some of Asia&rsquo;s top professionals in the film industry. Beyond entertainment value, the photos also show how these wartime stories are vehicles for a look at normal life and romance, and can even have historical value.<\/p>\n<p>Frayer has been covering Chinese culture for more than two years. Earlier this year, he won the <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3824266\/kevin-frayer-diana-markosian-chris-hondros-fund\/\">Getty Images and Chris Hondros Fund Award<\/a>, which comes with a $20,000 grant to support his documentary work.<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.kevinfrayer.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Kevin Frayer<\/strong><\/a> is a freelance photographer represented by Getty Images.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Mikko Takkunen<\/strong>, who edited this photo essay, is an Associate Photo Editor at TIME.

and share pictures. Panoramic city skylines become boxed vignettes, and that high-rise shot is pinched and squeezed into an abstract rooftop profile. But that&rsquo;s all about to change.<\/p>\n<p>Starting Thursday, Instagram will let users upload portrait and landscape photos and video, in addition to the 1&times;1 square format.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Square format has been and always will be part of who we are,&rdquo; reads an <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.instagram.com\/post\/127722429412\/150827-portrait-and-landscape\">Instagram press release<\/a>. &ldquo;That said, the visual story you&rsquo;re trying to tell should always come first, and we want to make it simple and fun for you to share moments just the way you want to.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Instagram users will be able to adjust the orientation of their photos to portrait or landscape by tapping on the format icon before editing. Once shared, the full-sized version of the photo will appear on other users&rsquo; feeds, but the post will still show up as a center-cropped square on users&rsquo; profile pages.<\/p>\n<p>The Facebook-owned company said the move is a response to some users&rsquo; demands for more flexibility. &ldquo;We know that it hasn&rsquo;t been easy to share this type of content on Instagram,&rdquo; reads the post. &ldquo;Friends get cut out of group shots, the subject of your video feels cramped and you can&rsquo;t capture the Golden Gate Bridge from end to end.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>But the change is also a way for Instagram to better capitalize on the growing rise of mobile video, especially as rival service Snapchat popularizes portrait-oriented smartphone videography. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re especially excited about what this update means for video on Instagram, which in widescreen can be more cinematic than ever,&rdquo; the post continues.<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x

Miners then wash and sift that gravel one shovelful at a time in search of tiny glints of light that might be a diamond. If they are lucky, a peppercorn-size crystal could fetch them a few dollars, once the mine owner gets his take. In New York&rsquo;s diamond district such a gem, cut and polished, would be worth several hundred dollars. Lynsey Addario and I journeyed to the heart of Congo&rsquo;s diamond mining district in August to report on an $81.4 billion industry that links the miners of Tshikapa with the glittering salesrooms of the world&rsquo;s jewelry retailers.<\/p>\n<p>It was an arduous trip, one that required an internal flight on an airline that has been blacklisted by the European Union for its shaky safety record, followed by long 4&times;4 drives on red dirt tracks down to the mining sites. Sometimes we had to take motorbikes, or boats, to reach the mines. Some of the richest gravel beds can be found at the bottom of the rivers that snake through the region. There, miners siphon gravel from deep under water using pumps mounted on rickety pontoons.<\/p>\n<p>In January, the provincial government banned child labor in Tshikapa&rsquo;s diamond mines, but with few other options for income, along with a lack of schools, many children, like 15-year-old Mbuyi Mwanza, have no choice but to work in the mines. Mwanza wants to grow up to be a nurse, but for the moment he is more concerned about feeding his family. His father, who is blind, cannot work. Stories like this abound in the region, but one organization is hoping to make a difference. The <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ddiglobal.org\/\">Diamond Development Initiative<\/a> (DDI), along with diamond jewelry retailer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ddiglobal.org\/\">Brilliant Earth<\/a>, has set up a pilot program for young students at risk of sacrificing their education to work in the mines. Right now there are only two Brilliant Mobile Schools, as they are called, in Tshikapa, and demand is high. DDI hopes to build more, if they can raise more funds. In the meantime the children of Lungudi village look on with envy as the Brilliant students, dressed in school uniforms, take classes in science, French, history and math in the tented classroom.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4011617\"><\/div>\n<p><figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/img_81361.jpeg?w=560&#038;quality=65&#038;strip=color&#038;h=560\" alt=\"IMG_8136[1]\" height=\"560\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"caption\" >TIME&rsquo;s Africa Bureau Chief Aryn Baker and photographer Lynsey Addario on assignment for TIME in the Democratic Republic of Congo. <\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>Tshikapa, population 600,000, betrays nothing of the wealth that lies beneath the ground. None of the roads are paved, not even the airport runway. The local hospital often turns patients away because it can&rsquo;t afford to treat them for free, and they can&rsquo;t afford to pay. According to the mayor, at least half the population has abandoned agriculture in favor of mining, leaving fields fallow and keeping the cost of basic food items high. Hundreds of miners die every year in drowning accidents and tunnel collapses that are seldom reported, because they happen so often. In the mining village of Kamabue, the local pastor tells the story of how a few years ago more than 60 miners searching an underwater grotto for diamonds in the nearby river were killed when the walls collapsed. He often urges his congregation to stay away from mining, but what is the point, he asks. There are few alternatives.<\/p>\n<p>Sixty-one-year-old Daniel Tunuanga got his lucky break as a miner 40 years ago, when he and his partner found a 4.6 carat diamond. They never returned to the mines. Instead, they sold the stone and opened up their own diamond buying business. It&rsquo;s not a lucrative job, says Tunuanga, but it&rsquo;s still better than digging.<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Lynsey Addario<\/strong>, a frequent <\/em>TIME<em> contributor, is a photographer represented by <a href=\"http:\/\/www.reportagebygettyimages.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Getty Images Reportage<\/a>.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Alice Gabriner<\/strong>, who edited this photo essay, is TIME&rsquo;s International Photo Editor.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Aryn Baker<\/strong> is TIME&rsquo;s Africa Bureau Chief.

face with one of the photographer&rsquo;s most iconic images: Bill Clinton on the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.magazine.org\/sites\/default\/files\/Esquire-Top40Covers-19.jpg\" target=\"_blank\">December 2000 cover of <em>Esquire<\/em><\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;[Colbert] looked at it and he came up with one of best lines I&rsquo;ve ever heard about my work: &lsquo;It looks like the Lincoln Memorial ready to party,&rsquo;&rdquo; the photographer says. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Stephen Colbert at his finest.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Platon has photographed hundreds of world leaders and celebrated actors but, he says, things were different with Colbert, who&rsquo;s featured on the cover of this week&rsquo;s issue of TIME. &ldquo;Most people I photograph start off as playing themselves, playing an authentic person that gradually, as they become more successful, [becomes] a brand,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;In many cases they are imprisoned by their brands. The brand overtakes the human being.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>With Colbert, this process has been turned on its head, as the comedian is still best known for the character he played on Comedy Central for many years. Now, as he gets ready to take the reins at the<em> Late Show<\/em> on CBS, he is dismantling that brand and becoming more of an authentic person on television. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going in the opposite direction than most people, and I find that very interesting,&rdquo; says Platon. &ldquo;My role here was to celebrate that moment where I&rsquo;m not photographing the Colbert character, I&rsquo;m photographing Stephen Colbert the human being.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"image-wrapper\">\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignnone\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/colbert-shooting2.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=65&#038;strip=color&#038;h=373\" alt=\"\" height=\"373\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" >Cory Vanderploeg <\/span><span class=\"caption\" >Platon photographing Stephen Colbert at his studio.<\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<\/figure><figure class=\"image-wrapper\"><\/figure><p>That moment was an exciting one for the photographer, who was also given unprecedented access backstage as Colbert&rsquo;s staff prepared for the show&rsquo;s Sept. 8 start. &ldquo;I saw the sets being built in the theater as they are transforming it and building it around his persona. It&rsquo;s his universe,&rdquo; says Platon. &ldquo;I had access to the writers&rsquo; room as well. I sat through the whole process of how you create one of the most successful TV shows. It&rsquo;s all about construction. You&rsquo;ve got a physical construction with all the carpenters literally building the stage. And behind the scenes, in the writers&rsquo; room, there&rsquo;s also construction. There&rsquo;s sawdust everywhere &mdash; in real and in conceptual form.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"4003149\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.platonphoto.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Platon<\/strong><\/a> is a portrait photographer based in New York City.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Olivier Laurent <\/strong>is the editor of TIME LightBox.

January, when Kurdish forces ended the Islamic State&rsquo;s five-month siege of Kobani, a contested town in Rojava, a semi-autonomous region on the Syrian and Turkish border, the local population rejoiced.<\/p>\n<p>The scene today is very different, says photographer Lorenzo Meloni, who, alongside his Magnum Photos colleague Moises Saman, photographed the region earlier this month. &ldquo;During the war, the enthusiasm for every victory over the Islamic State generated widespread satisfaction and gratification,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Today, however, the city is mostly destroyed. Many people have lost their homes. The unemployment rate is abysmal and although the reconstruction process has already began, it will take a long time and a lot of money before the city returns to a semblance of normality.&rdquo; As a result, many residents, especially younger people and families, are now contemplating leaving their homes behind for the chance of a new and better life in Europe.<\/p>\n<p>As Kobani has mostly disappeared from the headlines &ndash; despite a renewed ISIS offensive to retake the city &ndash; the impact of the war in Syria and parts of Iraq is being felt on European shores, as thousands of displaced people are looking to start over. &ldquo;We seem to forget that what will happen in this part of the world will be decisive for the whole of the Middle East and the Mediterranean area,&rdquo; says Meloni.<\/p>\n<p>Both photographers had a desire to document the conditions on the ground <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3933568\/isis-caliphate-one-year\/\" target=\"_blank\">six months<\/a> after Kobani&rsquo;s liberation. &ldquo;This is a topic that&rsquo;s usually forgotten,&rdquo; says Meloni. &ldquo;The idea was to give two points of view, each using our own language.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>For Saman, the project was an opportunity to gauge the impact of a collaboration on a news story, which he usually covers alone. It was also a chance for him to continue four years&rsquo; worth of work on the Arab Spring. &ldquo;I felt that the Kurdish story was a natural continuation of my work in the region,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Although the Arab Spring was predominantly an Arab phenomenon, its fallout &mdash; namely the civil war in Syria and the rise of the Islamic State in both Syria and Iraq &mdash; has profoundly affected Kurdish populations.&rdquo;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4003737\"><\/div>\n<p>The Kurdish pushback against ISIS forces is deeply linked to the Kurds&rsquo; dream of autonomy, with many Kurds of Iraq and Turkey speaking of this battle &ldquo;as if it were part of their own struggle,&rdquo; says Saman. And while it remains one of the few success stories against the totalitarian so-called Islamic Caliphate, it&rsquo;s also a source of tension in the region. In Serekaniye (the Kurdish name for Ras al-Ayn), both photographers could sense increasing Arab-Kurdish tensions. &ldquo;[We] began to see emptied Arab villages, some of which showed signs of having burned down,&rdquo; says Saman. &ldquo;This only increased as we approached Tell Abyad, a predominately Arab town that the [Kurdish People&rsquo;s Protection Units] recently won back from ISIS. That Arab-Kurdish tension was noticeable all the way until we reached Kobani.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Both photographers hope that their work will shed light on the Kurds&rsquo; growing sense of transnational identity, which is set against the backdrop of a ruinous civil war. And, more importantly, it may help the rest of the world realize that &ldquo;what happens in Rojava affects us directly,&rdquo; says Meloni. &ldquo;Or, at least, it should.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.magnumphotos.com\/C.aspx?VP3=CMS3&amp;VF=MAGO31_10_VForm&amp;ERID=24KL535GR6\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Moises Saman<\/strong><\/a> and <strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.lorenzomeloni.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Lorenzo Meloni<\/a><\/strong> are photographers represented by Magnum Photos.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Alice Gabriner<\/strong>, who edited this photo essay, is TIME&#8217;s International Photo Editor.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Olivier Laurent <\/strong>is the editor of TIME LightBox.

They&rsquo;ll cordon off the area two blocks around the house. And if the residents don&rsquo;t open the door, they&rsquo;ll break it down,&rdquo; says photographer Andres Kudacki.<\/p>\n<p>While shooting for the Associated Press in Madrid in 2012, Kudacki embarked on what would become a three-year project about evictions, hoping to tell a deeper story of the widespread, enduring consequences of Spain&rsquo;s financial crisis. His efforts will find an attentive audience as a featured exhibit at this year&rsquo;s Visa pour l&rsquo;Image photojournalism festival in Perpignan, France, at a time when Spain&rsquo;s economic woes seem all but eclipsed by those of Greece.<\/p>\n<p>Kudacki&rsquo;s photography puts individual faces to a crisis that has seen hundreds of thousands evicted from their homes since the 2008 housing market crash. Spain&rsquo;s unemployment rate, at 22.5%, is the second-highest in Europe after Greece, and it&rsquo;s simply impossible for many to make rent or mortgage payments. &ldquo;Everybody knows someone who&rsquo;s been evicted,&rdquo; he claims.<\/p>\n<p>The tragedy continues to unfold every day, over and over again, says Kudacki who initially found his sources with the help of housing rights activism group Plataforma de Afectados por la Hipoteca (PAH). He was soon covering up to four evictions a week. Those who lose their homes, he says, are usually forced to reoccupy evicted spaces, only to be evicted again later.<\/p>\n<p>To make matters worse, the victims often suffer astonishing heartlessness at the hands of police. &ldquo;The officers kick people to the ground and even push fingers into their eyes,&rdquo; says Kudacki. But the most brutal treatment, he discovered, is reserved for members of the press. &#8220;The police don&rsquo;t want to be the face of the evictions, because they are just executing an order delivered by a judge. But they will execute it no matter what.&rdquo; During one eviction, Kudacki was arrested and faced up to four years in prison before his lawyers managed to get his case dropped.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4007349\"><\/div>\n<p>Despite the risks he&#8217;s had to take, Kudacki&#8217;s work has sparked change for the better. One of his subjects, an 86-year-old widow named Carmen Ayuso, quickly became a symbol of the crisis after his portrait of her went viral on Twitter. &ldquo;She had been living in [her home] for 50 years,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Her case sensitized everyone to the problem. A local football club donated all the profits from one of their games to help her.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Aside from the direct impact his work has had on Carmen&#8217;s life, the opportunity to exhibit at Visa pour l&rsquo;Image is one of the most gratifying things to happen to him as a photojournalist, he says. &#8220;When the police are trying to arrest me or break my camera, they&#8217;re saying, &#8216;Your work is nothing.&#8217; But Visa pour l&#8217;Image is a space with such a good reputation. It says that [my] work is important and that it matters to society.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p><em><strong><a href=\"http:\/\/www.andreskudacki.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Andres Kudacki<\/a> <\/strong>is a freelance photographer based in New York.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Mikko Takkunen<\/strong>, who edited this photo essay, is an Associate Photo Editor at TIME.

It&rsquo;s not that photography is dead as many have claimed, but it&rsquo;s gone.<\/p>\n<p>Just as there&rsquo;s a time to stop talking about girls and boys and to talk instead about women and men so it is with photography; something has changed so radically that we need to talk about it differently, think of it differently and use it differently. Failure to recognize the huge changes underway is to risk isolating ourselves in an historical backwater of communication, using an interesting but quaint visual language removed from the cultural mainstream.<\/p>\n<p>The moment of photography&rsquo;s &ldquo;puberty&rdquo; was around the time when the technology moved from analog to digital although it wasn&rsquo;t until the arrival of the Internet-enabled smartphone that we really noticed a different behavior. That&#8217;s when adolescence truly set in. It was surprising but it all seemed somewhat natural and although we experienced a few tantrums along the way with arguments about promiscuity, manipulation and some inexplicable new behaviors, the photographic community largely accommodated the changes with some adjustments in workflow.<\/p>\n<p>But these visible changes were merely the advance indicators of deeper transformations and it was only a matter of time before people&rsquo;s imagination reached beyond the constraints of two dimensions to explore previously unimagined possibilities. And so it is that we find ourselves in a world where the digital image is almost infinitely flexible, a vessel for immeasurable volumes of information, operating in multiple dimensions and integrated into apps and technologies with purposes yet to be imagined.<\/p>\n<p>Digital capture quietly but definitively severed the optical connection with reality, that physical relationship between the object photographed and the image that differentiated lens-made imagery and defined our understanding of photography for 160 years. The digital sensor replaced to optical record of light with a computational process that substitutes a calculated reconstruction using only one third of the available photons. That&rsquo;s right, two thirds of the digital image is <a href=\"http:\/\/www.cambridgeincolour.com\/tutorials\/camera-sensors.htm\" target=\"_blank\">interpolated<\/a> by the processor in the conversion from RAW to JPG or TIF. It&rsquo;s reality but not as we know it.<\/p>\n<p>For obvious commercial reasons camera manufacturers are careful to reconstruct the digital image in a form that mimics the familiar old photograph and consumers barely noticed a difference in the resulting image, but there are very few limitations on how the RAW data could be handled and reality could be reconstructed in any number of ways. For as long as there&rsquo;s an approximate consensus on what reality should look like we retain a fingernail grip on the belief in the image as an objective record. But forces beyond photography and traditional publishing are already onto this new data resource, and culture will move with it whether photographers choose to follow or not.<\/p>\n<p>As David Campbell has pointed out in his <a href=\"http:\/\/www.worldpressphoto.org\/sites\/default\/files\/upload\/Integrity%20of%20the%20Image_2014%20Campbell%20report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">report<\/a> on image integrity for the World Press Photo, this requires a profound reassessment of words like &ldquo;manipulation&rdquo; that assume the existence of a virginal image file that hasn&rsquo;t already been touched by computational process. Veteran digital commentator Kevin Connor <a href=\"http:\/\/www.fourandsix.com\/blog\/2012\/2\/13\/photojournalism-ethics-on-shifting-technological-ground.html\" target=\"_blank\">says<\/a>, &#8220;The definition of computational photography is still evolving, but I like to think of it as a shift from using a camera as a picture-making device to using it as a data-collecting device.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The differences contained in the structure and processing of a digital file are not the end of the story of photography&rsquo;s transition from innocent childhood to knowing adulthood. There is so much more to grasp that very few people have yet grappled with the inevitable but as yet unimaginable impact on the photographic image. Taylor Davidson has <a href=\"http:\/\/taylordavidson.com\/2014\/camera\" target=\"_blank\">described<\/a> the camera of the future as an app, a software rather than a device that compiles data from multiple sensors. The smartphone&rsquo;s microphone, gyroscope, accelerometer, thermometer and other sensors all contribute data as needed by whatever app calls on it and combines it with the visual data. And still that&rsquo;s not the limit on what is already bundled with our digital imagery.<\/p>\n<p>Our instruments are connected to satellites that contribute GPS data while connecting us to the Internet that links our data to all the publicly available information of Wikipedia, Google and countless other resources that know where we are, who was there before us and the associated economic, social and political activity. Layer on top of that the integration of <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Lidar\" target=\"_blank\">LIDAR<\/a> data (currently only in some specialist apps) then apply facial and object recognition software and consider the implication of emerging technologies such as virtual reality, semantic reality and artificial intelligence and one begins to realize the mind-boggling potential of computational imagery.<\/p>\n<p>Things will go even further with the development of curved sensors that will allow completely different ways to interpret light, but that for the moment remains an idea rather than a reality. Everything else is already happening and will become increasingly evident as new technologies roll out, ushering us into a very different visual culture with expectations far beyond simple documentation.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4003527\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"time-embed time-embed__instagram\" data-provider=\"instagram\" data-url=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/1hHOB9qm0Y\/?taken-by=tomasvh\" >\n<div class=\"embed-instagram\">\n<blockquote class=\"instagram-media\" data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=\"4\" style=\" background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:500px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% - 2px); width:calc(100% - 2px);\">\n<div style=\"padding:8px;\">\n<div style=\" background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:50% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;\">\n<div style=\" background:url(data:image\/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAAGFBMVEUiIiI9PT0eHh4gIB4hIBkcHBwcHBwcHBydr+JQAAAACHRSTlMABA4YHyQsM5jtaMwAAADfSURBVDjL7ZVBEgMhCAQBAf\/\/42xcNbpAqakcM0ftUmFAAIBE81IqBJdS3lS6zs3bIpB9WED3YYXFPmHRfT8sgyrCP1x8uEUxLMzNWElFOYCV6mHWWwMzdPEKHlhLw7NWJqkHc4uIZphavDzA2JPzUDsBZziNae2S6owH8xPmX8G7zzgKEOPUoYHvGz1TBCxMkd3kwNVbU0gKHkx+iZILf77IofhrY1nYFnB\/lQPb79drWOyJVa\/DAvg9B\/rLB4cC+Nqgdz\/TvBbBnr6GBReqn\/nRmDgaQEej7WhonozjF+Y2I\/fZou\/qAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;\"><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p style=\" margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;\"> <a href=\"https:\/\/instagram.com\/p\/1hHOB9qm0Y\/\" style=\" color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;\" target=\"_top\">The world through an app #15: 3D weather overlay. #augmentedreality #machinevision #appeyeview #theworldthroughanapp<\/a><\/p>\n<p style=\" color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;\">A photo posted by Tomas van Houtryve (@tomasvh) on <time style=\" font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;\" datetime=\"2015-04-16T01:28:56+00:00\">Apr 15, 2015 at 6:28pm PDT<\/time><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><script async defer src=\"\/\/platform.instagram.com\/en_US\/embeds.js\"><\/script><\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p>Computational photography draws on all these resources and allows the visual image to create a picture of reality that is infinitely richer than a simple visual record, and with this comes the opportunity to incorporate deeper levels of knowledge. It won&rsquo;t be long before photographers are making images of what they know, rather than only what they see. Mark Levoy, formerly of Stanford and now of Google <a href=\"http:\/\/unframed.lacma.org\/\/2014\/01\/21\/marc-levoy-on-google-glass-and-photography\/\" target=\"_blank\">puts<\/a> it this way, &ldquo;Except in photojournalism, there will be no such thing as a &lsquo;straight photograph&rsquo;; everything will be an amalgam, an interpretation, an enhancement or a variation &ndash; either by the photographer as auteur or by the camera itself.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>As we tumble forwards into these unknown territories there&rsquo;s a curious throwback to a moment in art history when 100 years ago the Cubists revolutionized ways of seeing using a very similar (albeit analog) approach to what they saw. Picasso, Braque and others deconstructed the world and reassembled it not in terms of what they saw, but rather in terms of what they knew using multiple perspectives to depict a deeper understanding.<\/p>\n<p>While the photographic world wrestles with even such basic tools as Photoshop there is no doubt that we&rsquo;re moving into a space more aligned with Cubism than Modernism. It will not be long before our audiences demand more sophisticated imagery that is dynamic and responsive to change, connected to reality by more than a static two-dimensional rectangle of crude visual data isolated in space and time. We&rsquo;ll look back at the black-and-white photograph that was the voice of truth for nearly a century, as a simplistic and incomplete source of information about what was happening in the world.<\/p>\n<p>Some will consider this a threat, seeing only the danger of distortion and undetectable fakery and it&rsquo;s certainly true that we&rsquo;ll need to develop new measures by which to read imagery. We&rsquo;re already highly skilled in distinguishing probable and improbable information and we know how to read written journalism (which is driven entirely by the writer&rsquo;s imaginative ability to interpret reality in symbolic form) and we don&rsquo;t confuse advertising imagery with documentary, nor the photo illustration on a magazine&rsquo;s cover with the reportage inside. Fraud will always be a risk but with over a century of experience we&rsquo;ve learned that we can&rsquo;t rely on the mechanical process to protect us. New conventions will emerge and all the artistry that&rsquo;s been developed since the invention of photography will find richer and deeper opportunities to express information, ideas and emotions with no greater risk to truth than we currently experience. The enriched opportunities for storytelling will allow greater complexity that&rsquo;s closer to reality than the thinned-down simplification of 20th Century journalism and will open unprecedented connection between the subject and the viewer.<\/p>\n<p>The twist is that new forces will be driving the process. The clue is in what already occurred with the smartphone. The revolutionary change in photography&rsquo;s cultural presence wasn&rsquo;t led by photographers, nor publishers or camera manufacturers but by telephone engineers, and this process will repeat as business grasps the opportunities offered by new technology to use visual imagery in extraordinary new ways, throwing us into new and wild territory. It&rsquo;s happening already and we&rsquo;ll see the impact again and again as new apps, products and services hit the market.<\/p>\n<p>We owe it to the medium that we&rsquo;ve nurtured into adolescence to stand by it and support it in adulthood even though it might seem unrecognizable in its new form. We know the alternative: it will be out the door and hanging with the wrong crowd while we sit forlornly in the empty nest wondering what we did wrong. The first step is to stop talking about the child it once was and to put away the sentimental memories of photography as we knew it for all these years.<\/p>\n<p>It&rsquo;s very far from dead but it&rsquo;s definitely left the building.<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"4\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4029769041001-4\"

&ldquo;It was an epic biblical storm,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It was a light show, a dramatic storm out of central casting.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The experience prompted New York photographer Eric Meola to return to the Great Plains years later, with camera in hand. It would be the beginning of a three-year project spanning nearly 25,000 miles of what he calls &ldquo;the most beautiful places on earth.&rdquo; The project, titled <em>Tornado Alley: The Sky Above the Land Below, <\/em>will be featured in an upcoming <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bernarduccimeisel.com\/upcoming\/\" target=\"_blank\">gallery exhibition<\/a> in New York City.<\/p>\n<p>Traveling across more than seven Midwestern states with a professional storm-chasing group called <a href=\"https:\/\/www.tempesttours.com\/\">Tempest Tours<\/a>, Meola documented everything from hair-raising tornadoes to serene sunsets. While interested in the interplay between light and color in the sky, he also sought to portray signs of life in the old towns they visited. &ldquo;A gnarled tree, a road sign, railroad tracks,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Something like that can scale the photograph and offer context.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<figure class=\"inline-portrait_small_2x alignleft\"><img src=\"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/car_on_road-1.jpg?w=560&#038;quality=65&#038;strip=color&#038;h=560\" alt=\"storm-america-eric-meola\" height=\"560\">\n<figcaption class=\"image-caption\" ><span class=\"credit\" ><em>Eric Meola<\/em><\/span><\/figcaption><\/figure>\n<p>He studied under Pete Turner, a colorist whose stylistic methods influenced Meola&rsquo;s use of saturated color. In the storm images, Meola used post-processing to correct what the camera failed to accurately capture and bring back the image he remembers with his eye, he says. &ldquo;You get purple in the blue skies when there is lightning, sunsets provide the warm colors, and then the blues and greens come from the hail in the clouds.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>While the deadly force of a storm can wreak havoc upon a community, he hopes his work reminds the justifiably safety-conscientious observer that there is another side to these storms. &ldquo;You are miles away from the nearest town and you are looking at these beautiful, flat horizons with endless wheat fields, long roads and dramatic rolling hills,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Then in all of the peacefulness comes this angry sky that is almost exploding with energy and light, form and shape. Nature truly is beautiful.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong><em>Storm Chaser: New Photographs <\/em><\/strong><em>will be on view at the <\/em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.bernarduccimeisel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Bernarducci Meisel Gallery<\/em><\/a><em> from September 3 to 26, with an opening reception September 3 from 5 to 7 p.m.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Paul Moakley<\/strong>, who edited this photo essay, is TIME&#8217;s Deputy Director of Photography and Visual Enterprise.<\/em><\/p>\n<p><em><strong>Rachel Lowry<\/strong> is a writer and contributor for TIME LightBox.

appended, Aug. 21, 2015<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hundreds of migrants trying to cross the border from Greece to Macedonia clashed with police lines on Friday, just a day after Macedonia declared a state of emergency and closed the border. Photographer Georgi Licovski captured this image of distressed children pushed against the police line and crush of bodies.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;For the f<span style=\"font-weight:400;\">irst time in my life I saw my colleagues&mdash;photographers and journalists&mdash;crying because of the situation,&#8221; Licovski told TIME after spending the day taking pictures at the border. He added that it was also the first time he has cried while working. <\/span><\/p>\n<p>When the Macedonian government allowed some migrants to cross into the country near the southern city of Gevgelija, people flocked to the passageway and tried to press through after the crossing was sealed once more. Macedonian police fired tear gas and stun grenades to subdue the crowd, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/world\/2015\/aug\/21\/crush-reported-as-migrants-try-to-cross-border-between-greece-and-macedonia\">the <em>Guardian<\/em> reports<\/a>.

I was kind of stuck in this parallel universe,&rdquo; the photographer says, her voice vibrating from the memory. Nightly dreaming is serious business for Sassen, just as important as the activities that shape her daily life, as for her, it is a wellspring of inspiration. Having accessed that &ldquo;parallel universe&rdquo; where memories, daily events and stories blend together at night, she now invariably seeks that dimension through her art.<\/p>\n<p>Her upcoming exhibition, <em>UMBRA<\/em>, opening for the first time in Paris at the <span class=\"st\">Atelier N&eacute;erlandais <\/span> on Sept. 11, plays with the idea of shade. Though this word comes from the Latin for &ldquo;shadow,&rdquo; <em>UMBRA<\/em> also explores Sassen&rsquo;s fascinating universe of sculptural bodies turned into shapes and stories, impalpable geometries of transcendent axes, forms and contours that transform the ordinary &mdash; a sheet drying in the sun, a cloud glimpsed between roofs, the shadow of a leaf &mdash; and dare to surpass the apparent. These images have an otherworldly feel as if seeking a dimension that might exist within those shadows, mirrors and reflections, within those childhood dreams.<\/p>\n<p><em>UMBRA<\/em>, commissioned by the Nederlands Fotomuseum in Rotterdam, is composed by six bodies of work &mdash; <em>Axiom<\/em>, <em>Totem<\/em>, <em>Larvae<\/em>, <em>Carbon<\/em>, <em>Rebus<\/em> and <em>Soil<\/em> &mdash; each one exploring the relation between realism and abstraction through the signature elements in Sassen&#8217;s work. In <em>Totem<\/em>, one of her most relevant works from 2012, silhouettes cut from a bright background offer diverse levels of interpretation. The horizontal landscape contrasts the vertical human shape, evoking, she says, the &ldquo;traces we leave as mankind on the surface of the earth,&rdquo; the constant dichotomy between nature and culture that we face every day.<\/p>\n<p>In her work <em>Marte<\/em>, the model&rsquo;s body becomes a field of meaning and exploration, and the mirror winks at this capricious game, multiplying legs and creating a space where the eye travels between two realities. Sassen&rsquo;s work bears traces of Surrealism, but the physical body often breaks in, a solid anchor to a necessary dimension of reality. In <em>Marte<\/em>, Sassen&rsquo;s eye slides along her friend&#8217;s bare neck, where the bony shoulder blade, pointy knee and timid fingers become both form and narration.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4004734\"><\/div>\n<p>The corporal element appears also in <em>Axiom <\/em>&mdash; inspired by Kazimir Malevich&rsquo;s black square poster with her injection of bright color. The shadow of a hand culminates the synergy between a small mirror in the burning sand of Kenya and the shadows cast by color perspexs. &ldquo;I still wanted to have this personal human element in the picture,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;We are always confronted with ourselves in the end, so I think it is beautiful to have this relation with the human body and the spiritual.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Far from being political or conceptual, Sassen is drawn by an intuitive experience of reality &mdash; her childhood in Africa, her vivid memories and the complexity caused by confrontations between the two cultures &mdash; all of which open up a space for discussion where her elements &mdash; the body, the shadows, the glasses &mdash; are just a thread of her semantic approach. &ldquo;I get inspired by certain things that I find on my path, and then I just go for it and most of the time it isn&rsquo;t until much later that I realize what it has meant to me personally,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;All artists in some sense make self-portraits, so my work is also kind of a self-portrait, I try to make it layered and complex for myself as well because that is what keeps on driving me,&rdquo; she says.<\/p>\n<p>The complexity of the multi-layered world she attempts to frame leads to a conscious ambiguity she purposely seeks in her photographs, pulling the viewer into a mutual, amplified wonder. &ldquo;What is real? What is true?&rdquo; she questions, as she stumbles upon multiple truths. &ldquo;My pictures function as some kind of mirror,&rdquo; she admits. &ldquo;I like to ask questions rather than give answers.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.vivianesassen.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Viviane Sassen<\/strong><\/a> is a Dutch photographer and artist based in Amsterdam.
