am become death, the destroyer of worlds.\" So said the physicist Robert Oppenheimer, who helped to invent the atomic bomb.</p><p>The two bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 killed around 200,000 Japanese people. No other species has ever wielded such power, and no species could.</p><p>The technology behind the atomic bomb only exists because of a cooperative hive mind: hundreds of scientists and engineers working together. The same unique intelligence and cooperation also underlies more positive advances, such as modern medicine.</p><p>But is that all that defines us? In recent years, many traits once believed to be uniquely human, from morality to culture, have been found in the animal kingdom (see <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150706-humans-are-not-unique-or-special\">part one in this two-part series</a>). So, what exactly makes us special? The list might be smaller than it once was, but there are some traits of ours that no other creature on Earth can match.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wd2ml\"}}</p><p>Ever since we learned to write, we have documented how special we are. The philosopher Aristotle marked out our differences over 2,000 years ago. We are \"<a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.html\">rational animals</a>\" pursuing knowledge for its own sake. We live by art and reasoning, he wrote.&nbsp;</p><p>Much of what he said stills stands. Yes, we see the roots of many behaviours once considered uniquely human in our closest relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos. But we are the only ones who peer into their world and write books about it.</p><blockquote><p> We see the roots of many behaviours once considered uniquely human in our closest relatives </p></blockquote><p>\"Obviously we have similarities. We have similarities with everything else in nature; it would be astonishing if we didn't. But we've got to look at the differences,\" says <a href=\"http://www.amnh.org/our-research/staff-directory/ian-tattersall\">Ian Tattersall</a>, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, US.</p><p>To understand these differences, a good place to start is to look at how we got here. Why are we the only human species still alive today whereas many of our early-human ancestors went extinct?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wd2jc\"}}</p><p>Humans and chimpanzees diverged from our common ancestor more than six million years ago. Fossil evidence points to the ways which we have gradually changed. We left the trees, started walking and began to live in larger groups. And then our brains got bigger. Physically we are another primate, but our bigger brains are unusual.</p><p>We don't know exactly what led to our brains becoming the size they are today, but we seem to owe our complex reasoning abilities to it.&nbsp; <em></p><p></em>It is likely that we have our big brain to thank that we exist at all. When we <em>&ndash;</em> <em>Homo sapiens &ndash; </em>first appeared about 200,000 years ago we weren't alone. We shared the planet at least four other upright cousins; Neanderthals, Denisovans, the \"hobbit\" <em>Homo floresiensis </em>and <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25423498\">a mysterious fourth</a> group.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wd2fv\"}}</p><p>Evidence in the form of stone tools suggests that for about 100,000 years our technology was very similar to the Neanderthals. But 80,000 years ago something changed.</p><p>\"The Neanderthals had an impressive but basically routine material record for a hominid. Once <em>H. sapiens</em> started behaving in a strange, [more sophisticated] way, all hell broke loose and change became the norm,\" Tattersall says.</p><p>We started to produce superior cultural and technological artefacts. Our stone tools became more intricate. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1162219\">One study proposes</a> that our technological innovation was key for our migration out of Africa. We started to assign symbolic values to objects such as <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/dec/09/ice-age-art-exhibition-british-museum\">geometrical designs on plaques</a> and cave art.</p><blockquote><p> There is little evidence that any other hominins made any kind of art </p></blockquote><p>By contrast, there is little evidence that any other hominins made any kind of art. One example, which was possibly made by Neanderthals, was hailed as proof they had similar levels of abstract thought. However, it is a simple etching and some question <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/neanderthals-made-some-of-europe-s-oldest-art-1.15805\">whether Neanderthals made it at all</a>. The symbols made by <em>H. sapiens</em> are clearly more advanced. We had also been around for 100,000 years before symbolic objects appeared so what happened?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wd29p\"}}</p><p>Somehow, our language-learning abilities were gradually \"switched on\", Tattersall argues. In the same way that early birds developed feathers before they could fly, we had the mental tools for complex language before we developed it.</p><p>We started with language-like symbols as a way to represent the world around us, he says. For example, before you say a word, your brain first has to have a symbolic representation of what it means. These mental symbols eventually led to language in all its complexity and the ability to process information is the main reason we are the only hominin still alive, Tattersall argues.</p><p>It's not clear exactly when speech evolved, or how. But it seems likely that it was partly driven by another uniquely human trait: our superior social skills.</p><blockquote><p> While both chimps and humans cooperate, we will always help more </p></blockquote><p>Comparative studies between humans and chimps show that while both will cooperate, humans will always help more. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150407-are-you-nicer-than-a-child\">Children seem to be innate helpers</a>. They act selflessly before social norms set in. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cdep.12101\">Studies have shown</a> that they will spontaneously open doors for adults and pick up \"accidentally\" dropped items. They will even stop playing to help. Their sense of fairness begins young. Even if an experiment is unfairly rigged so that one child receives more rewards, they will ensure a reward is fairly split.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wd2vw\"}}</p><p>We know that chimpanzees also work together and share food in apparently unselfish ways. However, <a href=\"http://wwwstaff.eva.mpg.de/~tomas/\">Michael Tomasello</a> of the Max Planck institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, says they will <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.066\">only cooperate if there is something in it for them</a>.</p><p>\"Humans do that too, but in addition they care about what their partner gets. In some experiments we have children as young as 14-18 months who seem to expect their partner to collaborate in certain ways and who share in ways chimps don't.\"</p><p>Human children are less selective about who they share with. Chimpanzees though, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.02.014\">largely only share</a> with close relatives, reciprocating partners or potential mates.</p><p><a href=\"https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/lds/research/warneken/warneken/\">Felix Warneken</a> of Harvard University in Cambridge, US, differentiates it like this. Children are \"proactive\", that is, they help even when presented with only very subtle cues. Chimpanzees though, need more encouragement. They are \"reactive\": they will hand over objects but only after some nudging.</p><blockquote><p> What happened in our evolution to make us reliant on each other? </p></blockquote><p>Something must have happened in our evolution, Tomasello says, to make humans increasingly reliant on each other. Our brains needed fuel to get bigger and so collaborative hunting may have played a key role in that. Our advanced teamwork may simply reflect our long history of <a href=\"http://doi:10.1038/nature10278\">working together to get food</a>.</p><p><strong>Mind readers</p><p></strong>The fact that our nearest relatives share too simply shows that it is an ancient trait. It was already present in the messy branch of early humans that led to us, but none of these other species were as hyper cooperative as we are today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wd2dl\"}}</p><p>These cooperative skills are closely tied to our incredible mind reading skills. We understand what others think based upon our knowledge of the world, but we also understand what others cannot know. The Sally-Anne task is a simple way to test young children's ability to do this.</p><p>The child witnesses a doll called Sally putting a marble in a basket in full view of another doll, Anne. When Sally leaves the room, Anne moves the marble to a box. Sally then comes back, and the experimenter asks the child where Sally will look for the marble.</p><blockquote><p> Chimpanzees know what others know and what others can see, but not what others believe </p></blockquote><p>Because Sally didn't see Anne move the marble, she will have a \"false belief\" that the marble is still in the basket. Most 4-year-olds can grasp this, and say that Sally will look in the basket. They know the marble is not there, but they also understand that Sally is missing the key bit of information. <strong><br /> </strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131125-can-this-sneaky-chimp-read-minds\">Chimps can knowingly deceive others</a>, so they understand the world view of others to some extent. However, they cannot understand others' false beliefs. In a chimpanzee version of the Sally-Anne task, <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1006/anbe.2000.1518\">researchers found</a> that they understand when a competitor is ignorant of the location of food, but not when they have been misinformed. <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2008.08.010\">Tomasello puts it like this</a>: chimpanzees know what others know <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131125-can-this-sneaky-chimp-read-minds\">and what others can see</a>, but not what others believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p> We are unique in the level of abstractness with which we can reason about others' mental states </p></blockquote><p>This tells us something profound about ourselves. While we are not the only creatures who understand that others have intentions and goals, \"we are certainly unique in the level of abstractness with which we can reason about others' mental states\", says <a href=\"http://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/staff/katja_karg/index.php\">Katja Karg</a>, also of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wd3cj\"}}</p><p>When you pull together our unparalleled language skills, our ability to infer others' mental states and our instinct for cooperation, you have something unprecedented. Us.</p><p>Just look around you, Tomasello says, \"we're chatting and doing an interview, they (chimps) are not.\"</p><p>We have our advanced language skills to thank for that. We may see evidence of basic linguistic abilities in chimpanzees, but we are the only ones writing things down.</p><p>We tell stories, we dream, we imagine things about ourselves and others and we spend a great deal of time thinking about the future and analysing the past.</p><blockquote><p> We have a fundamental urge to link our minds together </p></blockquote><p>There's more to it, <a href=\"https://www.psy.uq.edu.au/directory/index.html?id=39\">Thomas Suddendorf</a>, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Queensland in Australia is keen to point out. We have a fundamental urge to link our minds together. \"This allows us to take advantage of others' experiences, reflections and imaginings to prudently guide our own behaviour.</p><p>\"We link our scenario-building minds into larger networks of knowledge.\" This in turn helps us to accumulate information through many generations.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wd2c0\"}}</p><p>That our rapidly expanding technology has allowed us all to become instant publishers means we can share such information at the touch of a button. And this transmission of ideas and technology helps us in our quest to uncover even more about ourselves. That is, we use language to continue ideas that others put forward.</p><p>Of course, we pass on the good and the bad. The technology that defines us can also destroy worlds.</p><p>Take murder. Humans aren't the only species that kill each other. We're not even the only <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22229682.600-only-known-chimp-war-reveals-how-societies-splinter.html\">species that fight wars</a>. But our intelligence and social prowess mean we can do so on an unprecedented scale.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wd2h2\"}}</p><p><a href=\"http://darwin-online.org.uk/converted/published/1871_Descent_F937/1871_Descent_F937.1.html\">Charles Darwin, in his book The Descent of Man,</a> wrote that humans and animals only differ in degree, not kind. This still stands true but Suddendorf says that it is precisely these gradual changes that make us extraordinary and has led to \"radically different possibilities of thinking\".</p><p>And it is these thoughts that allow us to pinpoint to our differences with chimpanzees. That we do so is because they are the closest living relative we have. If any of the now extinct early humans were still alive, we would be comparing our behaviour to them instead.</p><p>Still, as far as we know, we are the only creatures trying to understand where we came from. We also peer further back in time, and further into the future, than any other animal. What other species would think to ponder the age of the universe, or how it will end?\"</p><p>We have an immense capacity for good. At the same time we risk driving our closest relatives to extinction and destroying the only planet we have ever called home.</p><p><em>This is part of a two-part feature series looking at whether humans are really unique.

If it was just 100 light years away it could blow the atmosphere off,&rdquo; says Gehrels matter-of-factly.</p><p>&ldquo;The chances of that happening to the Earth is fairly small, about once in a billion years,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not as great a threat as a giant asteroid hitting our planet.&rdquo; Still, it probably pays to keep an eye on them.</p><p><strong>Round-the-clock detection</strong></p><p>Gehrels leads the international team of scientists &ndash; with members in the US, UK and Italy &ndash; operating the Swift satellite, which they use to study the behaviour and origins of these cosmic events . In orbit since November 2004, the spacecraft is named after its ability to respond instantly to any of the 90 or so high-energy flashes of radiation it detects each year.</p><p>As soon as Swift detects a gamma ray burst somewhere in its field of view, the satellite rotates to point its X-ray and optical telescopes in that direction. Meanwhile back on Earth, within a few seconds of the blast going off, the science team are notified by text message.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w1w\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately &ndash; even if we&rsquo;re on the road somewhere &ndash; we&rsquo;ll go to our laptops, log in and then get on the phone to teleconference with other members of the team,&rdquo; says Gehrels. Within 15 minutes of the burst, they will have issued an alert so that other observatories on the ground can point their telescopes towards the source.</p><p>Like being a doctor on call, duty scientists working on Swift even get woken up in the middle of the night to react to an event on the other side of the cosmos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting, you&rsquo;re making discoveries and learning something new at all hours of the day and night.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Black holes and revelations</strong></p><p>However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. &ldquo;My wife was amused by this at the beginning, pretty soon it got to be annoying,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;As more time went on, she&rsquo;d just sleep right through it.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Swift was launched, no one knew for sure what caused gamma ray bursts. Now astronomers are fairly certain that the longer bursts &ndash; that is anything over two seconds &ndash; are caused when the centre of massive stars collapse in on themselves forming black holes. When the stars subsequently explode into oblivion, a jet of gamma rays is blasted out across space.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w89\"}}</p><p>The second type of these explosions (anything shorter than two seconds) is categorised as short bursts. The Swift team has concluded that these are caused by the collision of two dense neutron stars. These cosmic bodies are just a few kilometres across but have a similar mass to the Sun. Which helps explain why the resulting explosion is so phenomenal.</p><p>What the Swift scientists have also discovered is that gamma ray bursts are vitally important to the evolution of the Universe. &ldquo;When a gamma ray burst goes off near a star with a planetary system, it can have a very important and destructive influence,&rdquo; says Gehrels.</p><p><strong>Time warp</strong></p><p>The explosions that result in gamma ray bursts might even have provided all the gold in the Universe. &ldquo;There was a burst that had an unusual afterglow that told us that a lot of heavy elements like gold had been produced,&rdquo; Gehrels says. &ldquo;It certainly gives us a clue where gold comes from.&rdquo;</p><p>Because light from the other side of the Universe takes so long to reach the Earth, some gamma rays bursts spotted by Swift actually began their journey towards us shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. When a blast goes off, it illuminates that particular region of space enabling astronomers to get a glimpse back in time to the birth of the very first stars 500 million-or-so years after the Universe came into existence.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wvk\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt what the early Universe was like,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;When the Universe was born, the only elements were hydrogen and helium but explosions started to seed the galaxy with higher elements like carbon, nitrogen and iron &ndash; the elements that make up our bodies.&rdquo;</p><p>Not only do we owe our very existence to cosmic explosions, there is some evidence that the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem has been directly affected by these bursts of energy. Research published in 2013 suggested that a blast of radiation that hit our planet in the 8th Century may have been the result of a gamma ray burst, though Gehrels is inclined to reserve judgement.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wcw\"}}</p><p>After 10 years of observations, he reckons Swift is good for at least another five years but it has already transformed how astronomers see the Universe.</p><p>&ldquo;Before Swift, astronomers used to think the Universe was a steady set of stars and galaxies,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;But if we put on our gamma ray glasses and look up at the sky, it&rsquo;s always popping and bubbling and flashing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very different kind of violent Universe.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The Nasa team keeping tabs on intergalactic death rays","HeadlineShort":"Nasa’s cosmic death ray spy ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A space mission tracking the most violent explosions in the Universe has just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;</p><p>Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.</p><p>So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.</p><p>Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? &nbsp;She disagrees that science has offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a <a href=\"http://www.scienceshowoff.org/\">charity gig</a> the following evening, she is very funny.</p><p>As her &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might disapprove of her flippant attitude &ndash; but then, Scott understands just how powerful a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. &ldquo;Laughter seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;But it is never neutral &ndash; there&rsquo;s always a meaning to it.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><blockquote><p>Laughter increases the pain threshold and may send endorphins shooting through our veins.</p></blockquote>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-03-23T03:42:44Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do we laugh inappropriately?","HeadlineShort":"Why do we get the giggles?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often find ourselves laughing at the strangest of moments.

In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;</p><p>Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word &ldquo;cummerbund&rdquo; occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through the audience.</p><p>So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success &ndash; the audience froze under the attention.

Yet you probably wouldn&rsquo;t think that if you waded through the scientific literature. That's because most scientific accounts of sexual behaviour rest upon evolutionary explanations rather than the more immediately relevant mental and emotional experiences. To say that we have sex because it helps us to preserve our genetic legacies would be entirely accurate, but the more fleeting, experiential, pleasurable aspects of that most basic of social urges would be missing. It would be like staring at a painting with half the colour spectrum removed from it.</p><p>One thing we have been curious about, though, is whether we are the only species that experiences sexual pleasure. The question of whether non-human animals enjoy it too is a perennial &ndash; and scientifically legitimate &ndash; question to ask. <br /> <strong><br /> </strong>In the last 10 to 15 years, scientific evidence has begun to accumulate that animals do experience a general sensation of pleasure &ndash; as anybody who has stroked a cat will know. In 2001, for example, psychologists Jeffrey Burgdorf and Jaak Panskepp discovered that <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003193840000411X\">laboratory rats enjoyed being tickled</a>, emitting a sort of <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031938403001598\">chirpy laugh</a> outside the range of human hearing. And not only that, they would actively seek out the feeling.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p020xk2t\"}}</p><p>But does that include carnal pleasure too? One way to find out is to study instances of sex that can't possibly result in procreation &ndash; for instance, among two or more males, or females; where one or more individual is sexually immature, or sex that occurs outside of the breeding season.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/life/Bonobo\">Bonobos</a>, for example, the so-called \"hippie apes,\" are known for same-sex interactions, and for interactions between mature individuals and sub-adults or juveniles. But you don't need to be a bonobo to enjoy \"non-conceptive\" sex, white-faced capuchin monkeys do it too. In both species, primatologists Joseph Manson, Susan Perry, and Amy Parish, found that that females' solicitation of males was decoupled from their fertility. In other words, they had <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1026395829818\">plenty of sex even when pregnancy was impossible</a> &ndash; such as when they were already pregnant, or while lactating just following birth. In addition, interactions among mature and immature individuals were just as common as interactions between two adults, for both species.</p><p>If animals indulge in more sex than is strictly necessary for conception, that too might hint at a pleasure-driven motivation to do the deed. A female lion may mate 100 times per day over a period of about a week, and with multiple partners, each time she ovulates. It only takes one eager sperm to begin the road from conception to birth, but the lioness doesn't seem to mind. Could it be that she enjoys it? Similarly high rates of encounters have been observed among cougars and leopards, too.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p020xkxv\"}}<strong><em></p><p></em></strong>Another way you might learn whether non-human animals derive pleasure is whether they have orgasms. That's especially true for females, since conception does not rely on their ability to experience one. Italian researchers Alfonso Troisi and Monica Carosi spent <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347298908983\">238 hours watching Japanese macaques</a>, and witnessed 240 individual copulations between males and females. In a third of those copulations, they observed what they called female orgasmic responses: \"the female turns her head to look back at her partner, reaches back with one hand, and grasps the male.\"</p><p>While it's impossible to ask a female macaque to interrogate her feelings, it is reasonable to infer that this behaviour is similar to that experienced by human women, at least in some ways. That's in part because this macaque behaviour is sometimes accompanied by the type of physiological changes seen in humans, such as increases in heart rate and vaginal spasms. Interestingly, the female macaques were more likely to experience a response when copulating with a male who lived higher-up in their monkey dominance hierarchy, suggesting that there is a social, not just physiological, component to this, not simply a reflexive responses to sexual stimulation.</p><p>Oral sex also occurs with some frequency throughout the animal kingdom. It's been observed in primates, spotted hyenas, goats and sheep. Female cheetahs and lions lick and rub the males' genitals as a part of their courtship ritual. <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0007595\">Oral sex is also well known among short-nosed fruit bats</a>, for whom it is thought to prolong copulation, thereby increasing the likelihood of fertilisation. <strong><em></p><p></em></strong>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p020xl3r\"}}<strong><em></p><p></em></strong>The most instructive example may come from a study of two captive male brown bears published earlier this year in the journal Zoo Biology. Over the course of six years, researchers amassed 116 hours of behavioural observations, which included <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/zoo.21137/abstract?deniedAccessCustomisedMessage=&amp;userIsAuthenticated=true\">28 acts of oral sex between the two bears</a>, who lived together in an enclosure at a sanctuary in Croatia.</p><p>The researchers, led by Agnieszka Sergiel of the Polish Academy of Sciences Department of Wildlife Conservation, suspect that the behaviour began as a result of early deprivation of suckling behaviour, since both bears were brought to the sanctuary as orphans, before they were fully weaned from their absentee mothers. It persisted for years, even after the bears aged out of cub-hood, perhaps because it remained pleasurable and satisfying.</p><p>In most cases, researchers rely on evolutionary mechanisms to explain such animal behaviour, to resist the pull of <a href=\"http://animals.io9.com/anthropomorphic-animals-make-it-harder-to-learn-science-1555118562/all\">anthropomorphosis</a>. As ethologist Jonathan Balcombe writes in <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159109000483\">Applied Animal Behaviour Science</a>: \"Pain's unpleasantness helps steer the animal away from 'bad' behaviours that risk the greater evolutionary disaster of death. Similarly, pleasure encourages animals to behave in 'good' ways, such as feeding, mating, and&hellip;staying warm or cool.\"</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p020xl9x\"}}<strong><em></p><p></em></strong>Yet Balcombe proposes that scientists shouldn&rsquo;t only view behaviour through the lens of evolution. He goes on to explain that rats prefer unfamiliar foods after three days in which they're only given a single type of food to eat. The simplest explanations for that pattern suggest that the rats' behaviour is adaptive because a diversity of foods allows them to ingest a wider range of nutrients, or maybe because it allows them to avoid overdependence on a possibly limited food source. But is that too narrow a view, when it's equally plausible that the rats just became bored with their food and wanted to try something new? To spice things up a bit? Both explanations are probably true, depending on whether you take an expansive, zoomed-out perspective, or a more immediate, zoomed-in perspective.</p><p>Likewise, sexual behaviour can be wholly enjoyable while also emerging from a deeper developmental or evolutionary origin. It is precisely because reproduction is so important to the survival of a species that evolution made it so pleasurable that animals &ndash; both human and non-human &ndash; are motivated to seek it out even when conception is undesirable or impossible. The urge to seek out that sort of pleasure, writes Balcombe, \"is a combination of instinct on the one hand, and a powerful desire to attain reward on the other.\" If so, it's clear why these powerful feelings of pleasure aren't only restricted to us humans.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Our animal behaviour uncovered.

Relationships can be fraught with the potential for miscommunication or misunderstanding at the best of times, so imagine how troublesome it is to admit, out loud, to your partner, that you've got a sexual interest or fantasy that sits far outside the cultural norms.</p><p>But here&rsquo;s a secret. For just about any fantasy between consenting adults that might be thought of as beyond conventional sexual practices or decency as dictated by society, you can bet that there's a non-human species for whom that particular behaviour is commonplace. Sure, there are plenty of examples of creative role-playing, food in the bedroom, or unusual places to do the deed, but even when you push the boundaries much further the chances are you&rsquo;ll find it happening in the animal world.</p><p>Take giraffes, for instance. Males, called bulls, make casual visits to various groups over time in search of a cow who might mate with him. In order to select the mating partner the bull literally finds the one that best suits his taste &ndash; by sampling their urine. Females co-operate in this \"urine-testing\" ritual, according to researchers <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222938500770471\">David M. Pratt and Virginia H. Anderson</a>. &ldquo;When the bull nuzzles her rump, she must produce a stream of urine if he is to catch some in his mouth and savour it,\" they write. If a cow is particularly attracted to a visiting bull, she may simply decide to urinate as he walks past her, no prodding required. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urolagnia\">Urolagnia</a>, or \"golden showers\" as it is more commonly known, is not a human invention, it seems.<strong> <br /></strong></p><p>While giraffes' social decisions are ruled by urine, hippos appear to rely on dung. The function and purpose of dung-showering is still only partially understood, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Behavior-Guide-African-Mammals-Carnivores/dp/0520080858\">according to</a> biologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Despard_Estes\">Richard Despard Estes</a>. What&rsquo;s clear is that dominant males defecate in order to mark the boundaries of their territories. University of Alberta scientists EL Karstad and RJ Hudson <a href=\"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/mamm.1986.50.issue-2/mamm.1986.50.2.153/mamm.1986.50.2.153.xml\">describe</a> one dominant male backing up to the riverbank and \"copiously defecating, scattering dung up to 2 metres in radius by flapping its tail vigorously.\" But there's more to hippo dung than <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2011/03/10/defending_your_territory_be_sm/\">simple territory demarcation</a>. When territorial males approach females they respond in a manner known as \"submissive defecation\". In this impressive display, the female turns around, lowering her head while raising her rear, then slowly wags her tail while defecating. In situations like this, dung-showering is thought to serve as a sign of submission.</p><p>Sexual fantasies aren't limited to urine and faeces, of course. Some people prefer their sexual encounters a little more on the rough side, but this is nothing compared with the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) found in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans. For them, sex has an added bite.</p><p>Stanford biologist Douglas J McCauley and colleagues carefully described the <a href=\"http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2984/64.2.349\">mating habits</a> of this toothy species in 2010. After being followed through the water at close distance by a group of males, a female was bitten on her tail by the lead male. While the tail bite slowed her down, she managed to briefly free herself before being bitten again, by the same male, on her body near her right pectoral fin. Having got hold of her, he guided her head into the sandy seafloor long enough to insert one of his two claspers into her cloaca, resulting in a sixty-eight second copulation. Shark scientist David Shiffman <a href=\"http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?p=14393\">pointed out recently</a> that biting may be a necessary consequence of mating in a three-dimensional &ndash; and slippery &ndash; environment. \"It ensures that the male remains close enough to the female to copulate.\" Female sharks of many species may have evolved thicker, tougher skin than males for this very reason.</p><p>Group sex appears to be another evolutionary strategy. Every spring in southern Manitoba, tens of thousands of red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) emerge from their underground hibernation dens and end up writhing in large &ldquo;mating balls&rdquo;. When a female garter snake emerges, she releases a pheromone that attracts hundreds of male snakes towards her. As if that isn't enough, scientists discovered that some male snakes &ldquo;cross dress&rdquo;; they release female-like pheromones to attract other males. One common assumption has been that pheromone-releasing males gain a reproductive advantage by diverting fellow male snakes attention from the female. But Australian and US researchers think this solves a <a href=\"http://people.oregonstate.edu/%7Emasonr/pdfs/064advantageoffemale.pdf\">more mundane purpose</a> &ndash; male snakes pose as females to warm up quicker and to reduce their exposure to predators.</p><p>The mourning cuttlefish (<em>Sepia plangon</em>) takes its cross dressing even further. This cephalopod, found in the waters off the eastern coast of Australia, controls the appearance of its skin <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2012/07/03/cuttlefish-woos-female-and-dupes-male-with-split-personality-skin/\">with exquisite precision</a>. When a male cuttlefish attempts to seduce a nearby female, he offers her a courtship display by controlling the arrangement of pigments that appear on the surface of his skin. If a rival male approaches, he changes his skin on the side facing the rival to appear female. The female still sees the courtship display, the intruder, however, thinks there are two females &ndash; leaving the original male to complete his reproductive business in peace.</p><p>Our societies may look down upon certain sexual interests as odd, weird, gross, or just plain silly. But as with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130123-what-are-friends-really-for\">friendships</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130109-why-do-animals-like-to-play\">play</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20121211-animals-that-seek-teenage-kicks\">teenage kicks</a>, investigating other species helps us to hold a magnifying glass of sorts &ndash; albeit one with a bit of distortion &ndash; up to our own behaviours. And if we squint real hard and tilt our heads to the side we might be able to catch a glimpse of the common threads connecting us with our non-human cousins. Even if it offends or challenges our norms.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook page</em></a><em> or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-02-22T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The wilder side of sex","HeadlineShort":"The wilder side of sex","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Humans may look down upon certain sexual interests as odd or gross, though chances are that animals indulge in a spot of similar behaviour too.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Humans may look down upon certain sexual interests as odd or gross, though chances are that animals indulge in a spot of similar behaviour too.","SummaryShort":"Fantasy in the animal world","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"8c3334d5-36a8-48b1-923e-ce603d2792f4","Id":"wwfuture/story/20130221-the-wilder-side-of-sex","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20130221-the-wilder-side-of-sex"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20130221-the-wilder-side-of-sex","_id":"55dc6363e2b83951eb996ac0"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>In 1987, an American pharmaceutical executive called Mary Ann Leeper flew to Copenhagen to get a first-hand look at what she thought might be the world&rsquo;s next great health innovation. She didn&rsquo;t expect to find it tucked away inside an old cigar box.</p><p>When she arrived at the old farmhouse owned by Danish doctor and inventor Lasse Hessel, he opened the door with a cigar in his mouth. Then he fetched the box. &ldquo;Inside were all these bits and pieces &ndash; metal, plastic, all different kinds of stuff,&rdquo; Leeper recalls. &ldquo;I took a deep breath and thought, &lsquo;Holy mother &ndash; what have I gotten myself into?&rsquo;&rdquo; Somehow, these bits and pieces fit together to form a contraption that women could wear during sex to prevent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections &ndash; the world&rsquo;s first female condom.</p><p>The presentation may have been unconventional, but Leeper and her colleagues at Wisconsin Pharmacal had high hopes for Hesse&rsquo;s invention. &ldquo;The Aids crisis in the United States was just fully being recognised, and it was clear to us that for women to have a product that they could use to help protect themselves would be a good thing,&rdquo; Leeper says.</p><p>Indeed, when Wisconsin Pharmacal finally introduced the female condom to the US in 1993, public health experts hailed it as a game-changer. The condom, a polyurethane pouch inserted into the vagina before sex, would protect women from sexually transmitted infections even if their male partners refused to wear condoms.</p><p>Technically, the female condom works. When used correctly, it reduces a woman&rsquo;s risk of contracting HIV by around 94&ndash;97% each time she had sex, according to estimates. Studies show that making female condoms available alongside the male version increases the percentage of sexual acts that are protected, and decreases the prevalence of sexually transmitted infections.</p><p>Yet, two decades after its much-celebrated introduction, the female condom still isn&rsquo;t living up to its potential. Less intuitive and familiar than the male condom, the device simply never caught on. Journalists mocked it, clinicians ignored it, and women shunned it, claiming that the condom was aesthetically unappealing and technically difficult to master. Today, only 1.6% of all condoms distributed worldwide are female condoms.</p><p>There may finally be an opening to change the female condom&rsquo;s fate. For years, a handful of researchers, engineers and entrepreneurs have been quietly tinkering with the device. Their efforts are now maturing and an assortment of redesigned and reinvented female condoms are beginning to make their way onto the market. The introduction of new, more user-friendly products &ndash; coupled with renewed efforts to promote the technology around the globe &ndash; may finally be positioning the female condom for a breakthrough.</p><p><strong>Barrier protection</strong></p><p>From the start, the female condom was a difficult project &ndash; far more difficult than Leeper had bargained for. After buying the rights to the technology, Leeper and her colleagues at Wisconsin Pharmacal needed to turn Hessel&rsquo;s prototype into a marketable product. After some tweaking, they ended up with a thin polyurethane pouch with a flexible ring at each end. A woman would insert the device by squeezing the ring that sits in the closed end of the pouch and pushing it into her vagina. Once expanded inside the vagina, this inner ring would keep the condom in place. The larger ring at the open end of the pouch would sit outside the vagina, covering the external genitalia. When a man ejaculated, the internal condom pouch would trap his semen, preventing pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections.</p><p>But before Wisconsin Pharmacal could put the condom on the market, they needed approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because the female condom was an utterly new kind of product, the FDA decided to regulate it as a Class III medical device, a category that is generally reserved for &ldquo;high-risk&rdquo; medical equipment &ndash; such as pacemakers and certain lasers &ndash; and that requires the highest level of regulatory scrutiny. (The FDA classifies male condoms as Class II medical devices, so they are subject to fewer controls and don't require pre-market approval.)</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t7yhv\"}}</p><p>It took six years for the female condom to wind its way through the regulatory system, and when the government finally approved it, in 1993, Leeper breathed a sigh of relief. &ldquo;I thought that the hardest part was going to be getting it through FDA because it was really difficult and they kept changing the specifications, the requirements, the clinical studies,&rdquo; she says. But she was wrong. The hard part was just beginning.</p><p>As Wisconsin Pharmacal prepared to launch the Reality female condom in the US (it would go by other brand names in other countries), they made all the standard arrangements, hiring sales reps to visit medical practices and commissioning a big advertising firm to market the product directly to consumers. &ldquo;We did all the checklist things that you&rsquo;re supposed to do,&rdquo; Leeper says. &ldquo;And we fell flat on our face.&rdquo;</p><p>The challenge, in part, was the era, and the public&rsquo;s squeamishness about a sex-related product. &ldquo;In those days, you couldn&rsquo;t talk &lsquo;condom&rsquo; out loud,&rdquo; Leeper recalls. &ldquo;Male condoms were referred to as &lsquo;rubbers&rsquo;. You said them in a whisper and they were held behind the counter by the pharmacist.&rdquo; And although the Aids crisis was raging, for many American women, the risk of contracting HIV was abstract, something that happened to other people and not to them. While women in focus groups had said they liked the <em>idea</em> of the condom, according to Leeper, &ldquo;when push came to shove, when they were in that bedroom, the female condom was out on the dining-room table&rdquo;.</p><p>There were other barriers, too. The condoms cost as much as $5 a piece, compared to male condoms, which can typically be had for $1 or less. Krissy Ferris recalls hearing about female condoms when she was a student at Oberlin College in Ohio, but the price was a deterrent. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t actually try one until I got free samples,&rdquo; recalls Ferris, who now works at a medical practice in Cleveland, Ohio. &ldquo;Am I going to buy $6 worth of condoms to try this out a couple times? It seems like maybe not. You&rsquo;re getting male condoms for free everywhere when you&rsquo;re in your 20s.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Scream test</strong></p><p>What&rsquo;s more, the female condom was, frankly, strange. Unlike the male condom, which is sold rolled up and compressed, the female condom came fully open. Women and men alike were turned off by the unfamiliar, big, plastic-bag-like device they found when they undid the packet. Though some women did eventually come to like the condoms, there was a definite learning curve and as many as one-third to one-half of women had difficulty inserting them. Once in place, the condom had a tendency to squeak or rustle during sex.</p><p>The media pounced on these complaints, and utterly skewered the female condom. They ridiculed its aesthetics with seemingly limitless creativity. As sociologist Amy Kaler recounts in her 2004 paper on the condom&rsquo;s introduction, journalists compared the product to: &ldquo;a jellyfish, a windsock, a fire hose, a colostomy bag, a Baggie, gumboots, a concertina, a plastic freezer bag, something to line Boston&rsquo;s Inner Harbor with, a cross between a test tube and a rubber glove, Edvard Munch&rsquo;s The Scream, something designed for a female elephant, something out of the science-fiction cartoon The Jetsons, a raincoat for a Slinky toy, or a &lsquo;contraption used to punish fallen virgins in the Dark Ages.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t8n6l\"}}</p><p>Though the media treatment was especially harsh, journalists &ldquo;were picking up on what were genuine design issues of the first generation of the female condom,&rdquo; says Kaler, an assistant professor at the University of Alberta in Canada. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t the most beautiful thing in the world. It was easy to make fun of. It was kind of laughed out of existence before it really got a chance to take off.&rdquo;</p><p>Still, there were signs that Wisconsin Pharmacal was onto something. In 1995, two years after bringing the condom to market, Leeper got a call from an official at Zimbabwe&rsquo;s Ministry of Health and Child Welfare. The health worker had received a petition demanding that the government of Zimbabwe bring the female condom into the country. It had been signed by 30,000 women.</p><p>Though Leeper had initially envisioned selling the female condom in America&rsquo;s private sector, the call from Zimbabwe, coupled with the condom&rsquo;s poor reception in the US, prompted the company to shift course.</p><p>International nonprofit groups and aid organisations have long been big buyers of male condoms. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), the US Agency for International Development, Population Service International and others regularly purchase male condoms in bulk and then donate them &ndash; or sell them at a deeply subsidised price &ndash; to clinics and programmes that serve particularly high-risk populations.</p><p>In 1996, Wisconsin Pharmacal changed its name to the Female Health Company and began to focus on this global public sector, working with governments, global health organisations and aid agencies to get the condoms into the hands of at-risk women in low-income countries. The female condom became a particularly important tool in several countries in sub-Saharan Africa, where, in the early 2000s, 60% of new HIV diagnoses were made in women, who often contracted the virus through their long-term partners.</p><p><strong>Sexual revolution</strong></p><p>Patience Kunaka, who was teaching nursing and midwifery students in Zimbabwe when she first heard about female condoms, knew these risks all too well. Two of her cousins had died of Aids-related causes, and three additional family members were infected with HIV. Like many other women, she was not initially impressed by the female condom. &ldquo;When I first saw one my immediate reaction was, &lsquo;Wow! How does it remain inside with penile movement?&rsquo;&rdquo; she recalls. &ldquo;I thought it would be sliding in and out and what a messy act! I also thought the plastic would crumble inside me causing discomfort.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t7ynk\"}}</p><p>But Kunaka suspected her partner at the time of being unfaithful and was &ndash; in her own words &ndash; &ldquo;obsessed about sexual hygiene&rdquo;, so she decided to give the female condom a shot. It didn&rsquo;t go well at first. &ldquo;I had problems inserting it and felt discomfort from the inner ring,&rdquo; she says. Slowly, after some practice, she got the hang of it. Kunaka even came to like the device, especially &ldquo;the fact that I don&rsquo;t have to beg my partner to use a condom&rdquo;.</p><p>She became a female-condom convert. &ldquo;In my African context, where men are at liberty to have as many partners as they can have, they give me power to negotiate for safer sex,&rdquo; she says. She even went on to get a job as the condoms and training manager for Population Service International Zimbabwe, and now spends her days spreading the word about female condoms to men and women throughout the country.</p><p>The female condom received a better reception in Africa than it had in the US, and as the Female Health Company sought to expand its global reach, it tweaked its original product, switching from a polyurethane condom to one made of nitrile, the same material used in many medical gloves. The nitrile condom, called the FC2, is significantly cheaper than its polyurethane predecessor, now commonly referred to as the FC1, and also less noisy during sex. In 2007, the UNFPA &lsquo;pre-qualified&rsquo; the FC2, making it eligible for bulk purchasing by public-sector agencies, and between 2007 and 2010, the number of female condoms distributed globally doubled from 25 million to 50 million.</p><p>Not bad for a contraceptive device that&rsquo;s been likened to The Scream<em>, </em>but it&rsquo;s still a drop in the ocean compared to male condoms. For every female condom that the major donor organisations purchase, they buy 71 male condoms. And although female condoms have got cheaper, price remains a limiting factor. An aid agency purchasing the FC2 in bulk will pay anywhere from $0.55 to $0.88 per condom but can get male condoms for as little as $0.02 a piece.</p><p>In many clinics in low-income countries, the supply of female condoms can be inconsistent, and the situation&rsquo;s not much better in the private sector. While pharmacy shelves overflow with male condoms of every imaginable kind &ndash; ribbed, studded, ultrathin, warming, aloe-enriched, neon pink, glow-in-the-dark, bubblegum-flavoured &ndash; it can be difficult to find female condoms for sale at all.</p><p>In some places, the condoms are stigmatised, thanks to clinical trials and distribution programmes that initially focused on sex workers. Elsewhere, the devices are still saddled with the baggage of the product&rsquo;s first, failed introduction. In March 2013, for instance, a writer for Jezebel, a popular feminist blog and news site, published a post titled &ldquo;Stop Trying to Make Female Condoms Happen&rdquo;. She expressed scepticism that &ldquo;women will change their minds about wanting to line their vaginas like a waste paper basket&rdquo;, and concluded by noting that &ldquo;female condoms are just ew&rdquo;.</p><p>More than two decades after the first female condom hit the shelves, this is not exactly the revolution that public health experts had in mind.</p><p><strong>Painful experience</strong></p><p>For nearly 40 years, Path, a global health nonprofit based in Seattle, Washington, has been radically reinventing basic medical technologies. The group&rsquo;s designers and engineers, for instance, created the Uniject: a disposable syringe pre-loaded with a single dose of vaccine. They built a one-size-fits-all diaphragm, removing the need for women to visit a doctor to have one specially fitted. And they invented a portable, handheld scale that health workers can bring to home deliveries. The scale requires no electricity, can be read in the dark, and is decipherable even to birth attendants with low literacy, making it easy to identify underweight infants.</p><p>In the late 1990s, Path turned its attention to the female condom. &ldquo;The Female Health Company did an incredible thing,&rdquo; says Maggie Kilbourne-Brook, a programme officer at Path. &ldquo;They created a product that had never existed, and they got it approved, and they got it registered and marketed in more than 100 countries. They actually changed people&rsquo;s perceptions of what barrier protection could be.&rdquo; But as it became apparent that the condoms weren&rsquo;t quite living up to their potential, some experts began to think that perhaps a radical makeover was in order. &ldquo;In product development,&rdquo; says Kilbourne-Brook, &ldquo;We always expect first-generation devices will need to be improved.&rdquo;</p><p>Path prides itself on its user-centred design process, and so, in an effort to create a female condom that women would want to use, those at Path decided to do something both radical and obvious: consult actual women. In 1998, Path began convening focus groups in four countries &ndash; South Africa, Thailand, Mexico and the US &ndash; asking women and men what they thought about female condoms and what they wanted from them.</p><p>From Durban to Seattle, it turns out that users&rsquo; desires were pretty basic: &ldquo;a product that was going to be easy to use, easy to insert, stable during use\", says Kilbourne-Brook. Plus, &ldquo;if it was possible, they wanted something that was more aesthetically pleasing&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t7ykw\"}}</p><p>These requests became the guiding principles for the designers and engineers working at Path&rsquo;s product development laboratory in Seattle. The team ran an iterative, multi-step design process, building prototypes of potential new condoms in the lab and then sending them out to heterosexual volunteers in each of the four countries. These women and men handled and examined each model, sharing their impressions with researchers, and couples received samples of some of the more advanced prototypes to try out in their bedrooms. The product designers used the feedback to refine &ndash; and sometimes utterly rethink &ndash; their designs and then sent new, tweaked models back for further testing.</p><p>Early generations of female condoms had relied on a ring-based design. One of Path&rsquo;s first prototypes was similar, with a polyurethane pouch anchored between two fixed rings. But some women reported that it was difficult to push the inner ring into the vagina &ndash; the same complaint often made about the FC1 and FC2 &ndash; and that it was painful once inside. &ldquo;Device is stable but uncomfortable,&rdquo; one Mexican tester reported. So Path decided to scrap the rings entirely. They briefly tested a prototype that could be inserted using a tampon tube applicator, but the condom didn&rsquo;t deploy reliably.</p><p>They spent a lot of time talking about how to improve insertion. &ldquo;We know from a user perspective, if you have a difficult time the very first time you try to use a device, a woman may never come back,&rdquo; says Kilbourne-Brook. &ldquo;We wanted this to be not only easy to use, but it needed to be easy to use for someone who&rsquo;s never used it before.&rdquo;</p><p>According to Kilbourne-Brook, the ultimate breakthrough was inspired by feedback from testers and researchers in Thailand, who said, &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be wonderful if you had some kind of insertion device that helped you insert it and then it got out of the way?&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Radical redesign</strong></p><p>By 2003, they had hit on the solution: a dissolving applicator. The engineers created a condom that looked like a funnel, with a thin sheet of polyurethane that narrowed into a rounded tip. This tip contained the main pouch of the condom, collapsed inside a dissolving capsule. To insert the condom, women would simply push the capsule inside, much the same way they&rsquo;d insert a tampon. Once it came into contact with the moisture of the vagina, the capsule would melt away &ndash; often within 30-60 seconds &ndash; releasing the full condom pouch.</p><p>The product designers gave the condom stability by attaching four small, thin pieces of polyurethane foam to the outside of the condom. Once the pouch expanded, these foam pieces nestled up against the vaginal wall, keeping the condom in place. Like other female condoms, the model also featured a flexible outer ring to cover the external genitalia.</p><p>Between November 2003 and January 2004, 60 couples received samples of this prototype to try at home. They were impressed. Eighty-eight per cent of the women said it was easy to insert and 97% said the pouch was stable during sex. The vast majority of men and women asked said the condom was comfortable, and 98% of women and 100% of men said it allowed for satisfactory sensation during sex.</p><p>It had taken six years and more than 300 unique prototypes, but by early 2004, Path had found its female condom.</p><p>The final product, which Path named the Woman&rsquo;s Condom, is &ldquo;just a brilliant design,&rdquo; says Kaler, who was not involved in its creation. &ldquo;When you look at it visually, it isn&rsquo;t huge. It&rsquo;s clear what you do with it. And the way that it&rsquo;s been designed with these foam pads means that it doesn&rsquo;t move around.&rdquo;</p><p>A series of larger clinical trials &ndash; conducted in Mexico, South Africa, Thailand, China and the US &ndash; has reinforced what Path found in its initial testing, with users reporting that the Woman&rsquo;s Condom is comfortable, stable and easy to insert. Several studies have found that both men and women tend to like the Woman&rsquo;s Condom better than the FC1 and FC2. Users&rsquo; main complaint was that it does not come pre-lubricated, as the FC2 does. Instead, each condom comes with a packet of lubricant that users can apply themselves.</p><p>In 2011, the Woman&rsquo;s Condom received the stamp of approval from the Shanghai Food and Drug Administration and is currently under review by the UNFPA; approval is expected in 2014. In the meantime, limited quantities are already being sold in China and South Africa.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Low-stress solution&rdquo;</strong></p><p>The Woman&rsquo;s Condom isn&rsquo;t the only new female condom on the scene. In 2012, the UNFPA pre-qualified the Cupid, which is manufactured by an Indian condom company. The Cupid relies on a ring-shaped foam sponge tucked into the closed end of the condom pouch for internal stability. Made of natural latex, the Cupid may be the cheapest female condom yet, and is now available for purchase in both the public and private sectors.</p><p>Several other condoms, each slightly different in design, are currently under UNFPA review. For instance, the Phoenurse, which is currently sold in China, comes with an optional insertion stick. Then there&rsquo;s the panty condom, in which a condom pouch is affixed to a pair of reusable panties with an opening over the vagina. Before sex, a woman can push the condom inside with her finger &ndash; or a man can with his penis &ndash; without her having to take off the undergarment.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t7zc4\"}}</p><p>And there are still more designs in the early stages of development. Origami Condoms, based in Los Angeles, California, has developed a silicone female condom that unfolds like an accordion as it&rsquo;s pushed into the vagina. The company just completed a small phase I acceptability study &ndash; overall, participants preferred the Origami condom to the FC2, though they said the FC2 felt more stable during sex. The company plans to conduct a larger clinical trial this year.</p><p>Not every product will be right for every woman or couple, but that&rsquo;s precisely the point. &ldquo;In the studies we&rsquo;ve done, we&rsquo;ve found that some women will say, &lsquo;I really love this one and I don&rsquo;t like this one at all&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Mags Beksinska, research director at the division of maternal, adolescent and child health at the University of the Witwatersrand, South Africa. &ldquo;There are different aspects that appeal to different women in the different designs. So it would be good if there was a wider choice.&rdquo;</p><p>Krissy Ferris, the woman who was initially turned off by the cost of female condoms, came to see their advantages while dating a man who had trouble maintaining an erection with a male condom. &ldquo;It was definitely a barrier to male condom use, and I was not ready to compromise on using a barrier method,&rdquo; she says. The female condom was a &ldquo;low-stress&rdquo; solution.</p><p>Over the years, Ferris has tried several different products, including the FC1, the FC2 and the VA w.o.w., which, like the Cupid, uses an internal sponge to hold the condom pouch in place. Ferris found that she preferred the VA w.o.w. because the sponge made it feel more secure during sex. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re using something with this desire for safety, having this extra measure of security was definitely a positive for me,&rdquo; she says. But the FC1 and FC2 felt more natural, she acknowledged, and for some women, that may be more important.</p><p>There is some evidence to suggest that women are more likely to have safe sex &ndash; and less likely to become pregnant or contract sexually transmitted infections &ndash; when a larger selection of contraceptive and barrier products is available. Giving women a greater choice in female condoms may increase the odds that they choose any female condom at all.</p><p>Meanwhile, male condoms are also getting a redesign. In November 2013, the Gates Foundation awarded 11 grants of $100,000 to designers, engineers and scientists with ideas for a &ldquo;next-generation condom&rsquo;&rdquo;&ndash; male or female &ndash; that would be easier and more pleasurable to use. The winning proposals include a male condom that is packaged with a built-in applicator, allowing the condom to be removed from its foil wrapper and donned in a single smooth motion, and a one-size-fits-all male condom designed to tighten during sex.</p><p><strong>Practice makes perfect</strong></p><p>Of course, upgrading a product is merely a first step. While the FC1 certainly had its flaws, they weren&rsquo;t the only reason that female condoms didn&rsquo;t take off. &ldquo;Some technologies are harder than others,&rdquo; says Laura Frost, a partner at Global Health Insights, a research and consulting firm. &ldquo;Compared to other products where there&rsquo;s one huge issue, like affordability or awareness, this one had those barriers at every stage.&rdquo;</p><p>That&rsquo;s why, for the female condom to truly break through, advocates will need to invest in comprehensive marketing and education campaigns at the local, national and global levels. &ldquo;It takes more than just putting it on the shelf,&rdquo; says Susie Hoffman, an associate professor of epidemiology at Columbia University in New York.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t8mzm\"}}</p><p>Female condoms remain less straightforward than male condoms, and one of the major lessons of the last two decades is that women often need a little bit of training to use them correctly. That means that clinicians and counsellors may have to do more than simply tell women that female condoms exist &ndash; they&rsquo;ll need to give them the opportunity to practise inserting one, either on a pelvic model or on themselves.</p><p>In addition, women may need help figuring out how to broach the subject with their male partners. Though the condoms have won praise for being female-initiated, they&rsquo;re not entirely invisible, and most men will notice if their partners are wearing them. &ldquo;In many cases, she&rsquo;s probably going to want to mention to her partner before having sex that this is a new product that she&rsquo;s going to try,&rdquo; Hoffman says. &ldquo;Ideally there&rsquo;s going to be some kind of a conversation about it, and women need help in figuring out how to do that.&rdquo;</p><p>Male partners are also a potential market. &ldquo;Men probably feel, when it&rsquo;s called the &lsquo;female condom&rsquo;, that it&rsquo;s not something that&rsquo;s for them,&rdquo; Mags Beksinska says. But &ldquo;there&rsquo;s no reason that a man shouldn&rsquo;t take one and bring it home and introduce it to his partner&rdquo;. In fact, she adds, once men get used to the female condom, they often prefer it to the more constricting male version. Female condoms even enhance sex for some people: the outer ring can be used to stimulate the clitoris, while the inner ring of some designs can bump up pleasurably against the tip of the penis.</p><p>The female condom may remain a tough sell, but the good news, experts say, is that there are now more organisations trying to make the pitch. &ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re seeing a much bigger coalition of advocates, which is what we need,&rdquo; Frost says. Some existing agencies, most notably the UNFPA, have stepped up their support, while champions have created a variety of new advocacy and awareness groups, including the National Female Condom Coalition in the US, and the Universal Access to Female Condoms Joint Programme, based in the Netherlands.</p><p><strong>New support</strong></p><p>Alongside this, the condom&rsquo;s supporters are getting more creative in their promotion efforts, establishing Global Female Condom Day &ndash; the first one was held on 12 September 2012 &ndash; and holding female-condom-themed fashion shows and film festivals. Several organisations have turned salons and barbershops in Zimbabwe, Malawi, Cameroon and elsewhere into female condom distribution centres, training hairdressers to promote and sell the product to both male and female clients. And all-out media blitzes in Africa &ndash; in which the condoms are promoted on billboards, television and the radio &ndash; have fed a sharp increase in demand.</p><p>&ldquo;I think people had kind of written off the female condom,&rdquo; says Beth Skorochod, a senior technical adviser at Population Service International. &ldquo;But now people are beginning to say, &lsquo;Ok, with more competition and more interest, maybe this deserves another look&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>There may even be hope for the hard-to-crack private sector in higher-income countries. After winning FDA approval for the FC2 in 2009, the Female Health Company relaunched the female condom in the US, creating female condom campaigns and programmes in a handful of major American cities, including New York, San Francisco and Washington, DC.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01t7zlj\"}}</p><p>Some local US groups are also beginning to lay the groundwork for the future. Staff members at the Chicago Female Condom Campaign now show off samples of some of the newest products &ndash; including the Cupid and the Woman&rsquo;s Condom &ndash; in their training and education sessions. The goal is to make sure that healthcare providers and consumers will be familiar with the products if and when they appear in the US. But there&rsquo;s an added benefit. &ldquo;Frankly what this also does is it helps to cultivate new female condom advocates,&rdquo; says Jessica Terlikowski, who coordinates the Chicago Female Condom Campaign and the National Female Condom Coalition. Seeing other products, she says, can prompt women to ask, &ldquo;&lsquo;How can I get that?&rsquo; &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t we have that here?&rsquo; People can&rsquo;t ask for or demand what they don&rsquo;t know about.&rdquo;</p><p>Women may soon have choices beyond the conventional condom. Scientists have been developing interventions that would be truly invisible to women&rsquo;s partners: oral antiretroviral pills and vaginal gels that prevent HIV. Despite the enormous excitement surrounding these drugs, they won&rsquo;t be magic bullets either, and the public-health community will still have to grapple with the thorny issues of education, access and adherence. Earlier this year, for instance, researchers announced that a clinical trial of two different HIV prevention pills and one vaginal gel, conducted among women in three African nations, failed because women weren&rsquo;t using the medications regularly.</p><p>Such outcomes are making it increasingly obvious that the global fight against HIV and other sexually transmitted infections is unlikely to be won with any one technology, no matter how elegantly designed. Instead, it will require an arsenal of weapons, a diverse array of tools that allow women and men to protect themselves. The female condom may never be as cheap or as popular as the male condom, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean it has no role to play.</p><p>Among those optimistic about the female condom&rsquo;s future is Lasse Hessel, the Danish doctor who started it all. The condom&rsquo;s champions made some mistakes in the early years, Hessel says, but he&rsquo;s encouraged by the recent resurgence of interest and the new products that are hitting the shelves. In fact, he wishes other inventors had redesigned his condom sooner, especially because there was so much room for improvement: &ldquo;How can my ugly, clumsy female condom get any worse?&rdquo; Hessel says. &ldquo;It can only get much better.&rdquo;</p><p><em>This article was originally commissioned by <a href=\"http://www.mosaicscience.com/\">Mosaic</a>, and reproduced under a Creative Commons licence.

On a chilly October afternoon, she sits at a round wooden table in a knitting shop in New York City and shows off her latest tattoo. Her companion, a 56-year-old nurse practitioner named Susan Ledlie, examines the design and grins, pulling up her sleeve to display her own.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Ledlie and Tanya (name changed) are an unlikely pair. Ledlie, a plump older white woman with a brisk maternal air, teaches graduate nursing at Molloy College in Long Island, New York, since retiring from her job as a nurse practitioner in 2010. Tanya, young and black with a cavalier attitude towards adulthood, grew up with her grandmother in Brooklyn, NY and wants to be a hairdresser. Yet the two have been close friends for 16 years. In 1995, when Tanya was six years old, her grandmother took her to Ledlie&rsquo;s clinic in Brooklyn. Tanya had HIV. She had become infected at birth when she came in contact with her mother&rsquo;s blood<strong>,</strong> and was diagnosed soon after.</p><p>&ldquo;The first time I saw Susan, I remember I had to get my shots for school,&rdquo; says Tanya. &ldquo;I was kicking and pushing Susan and she had to bring three other doctors in to hold me down.&rdquo; From that day forward, Ledlie saw Tanya at least once a month, as her primary Aids care provider - a role that included prescribing drugs, doing regular medical checkups and providing teenage counselling<strong>.</strong> &ldquo;Visits became like a family thing,&rdquo; Tanya laughs.</p><p>Ledlie&rsquo;s role was almost unthinkable three decades ago. In June 1981, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported the first known case of what would eventually become known as Aids. Just a year later doctors began to diagnose the disease in children. Initially, they were treated with <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zidovudine\">zidovudine</a> - the first antiretroviral medicine designed to treat HIV - or nothing at all. During these early years of relevant ignorance about the disease, 45% of HIV-positive children died before their tenth birthdays. &ldquo;We were focused on pain relief and comfort, without any thoughts about the child&rsquo;s future,&rdquo; says George Siberry, an adolescent HIV expert at the US National Institutes of Health.</p><p>But in the years since Tanya was diagnosed, there has been a dramatic shift in what it means to be born HIV-positive, particularly in western countries. Today, babies born to mothers infected with HIV receive anti-HIV medication within hours of birth and are not breast-fed so as to avoid passing the virus from mother to child. As a result, fewer than two babies in every 100 born to HIV-positive mothers in the US and Europe become infected with the virus. With treatment, 95% of kids now reach the age of 10. &ldquo;Since antiretroviral therapy, we&rsquo;ve showed they can live well into adulthood, although we don&rsquo;t know for how long,&rdquo; says Siberry.</p><p>This is Generation HIV. They are the first kids and young adults to have battled a lifelong infection since birth, and scientists are trying to understand what that really means. &ldquo;There are so many unanswered questions,&rdquo; says Yvonne Kingon, an HIV nurse practitioner in New York City who now treats Tanya. &ldquo;Are these kids&rsquo; immune systems the same when they&rsquo;ve been fighting a virus since birth? What does it mean to be an adult and have been on multiple medicines throughout your life?&rdquo; she says. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> A long-term study of 450 HIV-positive youth aims to answer some of those questions. The <a href=\"https://phacs.nichdclinicalstudies.org/overview.asp\">Pediatric HIV/AIDS Cohort Study</a> (pHAcs) began in 2005 and now has 21 sites across the United States. Researchers are studying two groups of adolescents: those infected with HIV at, or shortly after, birth, and those who were exposed to treatments as infants or during foetal. They hope to understand the effects of the long-term use of HIV medications and the impact of HIV on the biology and psychology of these children. Infectious disease specialists have been closely watching these young survivors, analysing their cellular makeup and immune health, and characterising the HIV virus in the context of these patients&rsquo; infections. The study will also collect information on immune function, neurological development, cardiac function, bone growth and metabolism. Siberry says the early results show some worrying results, such as increased risk of heart attacks, attention deficit and language learning abilities, as well as higher rates of asthma. &ldquo;But we won&rsquo;t know for sure until we&rsquo;ve followed this pioneering group into their 30&rsquo;s, 40&rsquo;s and 50&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he says.<strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>&lsquo;Dangerous secret&rsquo;</strong></p><p>According <a href=\"http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/progress_report2011/en/index.html\">to the United Nations</a>, at the end of 2010, there were 3.4 million children (under 15 years of age) living with HIV around the world &ndash; nine out of 10 living in sub-Saharan Africa. Every hour, around 30 children die as a result of Aids, but in the developed world, paediatric HIV has morphed into adolescent HIV, and brought with it a fresh set of obstacles. When Ledlie started as a paediatric HIV nurse practitioner in 1991, most kids who came to her clinic died by age three or four. &ldquo;They stopped crawling and holding their bottles&hellip;they became stiff as a board until they died,&rdquo; she says. But a couple of years into her practice, she reached the first landmark in her fledgling career. &ldquo;The first kid whose kindergarten graduation I could go to, that was a big thing,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It was like, &lsquo;wow&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p><p>Today, instead of fending off swift, deadly infections, practitioners - and HIV-infected youth - are grappling with subtle complications. Two danger areas, according to HIV researchers, are cardiovascular health and neurological illness. Early results from the pHAcs study and others show that many of the children who have been treated with anti-HIV medications since a young age have heart abnormalities, higher cholesterol levels, and above-normal rates of obesity and glucose intolerance&mdash;a precursor to diabetes. &ldquo;In the long run, these factors put the kids at higher risk of heart attacks and strokes,&rdquo; says Siberry. But scientists emphasise that these results don&rsquo;t necessarily herald an epidemic of cardiovascular disease among HIV-positive youth over the next decades. They are initial findings and more work needs to be done to understand what factors contribute to the risk. &ldquo;It just means we are mindful of the risk and exploring the use of new medications that don&rsquo;t increase cardiovascular side-effects,&rdquo; says Paul Krogstad, a physician and virologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p><p>These kids also have <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2775808/?tool=pubmed\">higher than normal rates</a> of mental health issues including depression, substance abuse, attention deficit disorder and learning difficulties. We don&rsquo;t yet know the effect of HIV on the brain during development,&rdquo; says Krogstad. It&rsquo;s still unclear whether the cause is social - a consequence of the kids&rsquo; socioeconomic backgrounds and speckled family history - or biological. &ldquo;It deserves close scrutiny,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Whilst questions like this will take time to answer, there are more immediate challenges facing Generation HIV.</p><p>Sex can be a messy issue for many young adults, but when an adolescent is HIV positive, it is even more complex. Unlike their peers, these teens have to think about public disclosure of their HIV status, the impact of their sexual encounters on their partners, and whether they want to have kids of their own. &ldquo;I kinda grew up with this disease and it&rsquo;s totally different now,&rdquo; says Ledlie. Pediatric Aids specialists are wading into unfamiliar territory when they begin talking about pregnancy with their patients. Because of the inextricable relationship between sexuality and HIV transmission, some small studies in the UK and the US have followed the pregnancies of young, HIV-positive women, to assess their reproductive and sexual health, and found their fertility remains relatively intact. One study did however find that a high proportion of girls had abnormal cervical cells, although this could be attributed to their increased susceptibility to genital infections like the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_papillomavirus\">human papilloma virus</a>, a cause of cervical cancer.</p><p>Tanya&rsquo;s long-term boyfriend still doesn&rsquo;t know she is HIV positive. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to tell a person whom you&rsquo;re already so [physically] close with,&rdquo; she says. Tanya says she always insists on using protection, but sometimes her boyfriend asks if it&rsquo;s because she &ldquo;has something.&rdquo; &ldquo;My excuse is that I don&rsquo;t want to get pregnant,&rdquo; says Tanya. But she has had a pregnancy scare. &ldquo;Susan sat me down and she was like, &lsquo;How do you wanna do this?&rsquo;&rdquo; says Tanya. Although Ledlie tried to convince Tanya to tell her boyfriend, she has refused to reveal her secret.</p><p><strong>Regime change</strong></p><p>Clearly, there are still huge challenges and unknowns. But studies of Generation HIV have also thrown up glimmers of hope. For years, physicians worried that children infected with the virus would grow up with crippled immune systems. But, research shows that most of the children have suppressed the infection and have nearly normal levels of the CD4+ immune cells that are typically destroyed by early HIV infection. That&rsquo;s good news.</p><p>Yet not everything is quite as it should be. Many of the group received their childhood vaccinations before they were put on HIV medications but after their immune systems had been compromised. This has made them more susceptible to certain viral diseases, such as shingles and its complications, as well as bacterial infections that can cause pneumonia and meningitis. &ldquo;Their immune systems were not in optimal shape to make a lasting protective response. That&rsquo;s something fairly unique about this group,&rdquo; says Siberry. &ldquo;We need to do something different to protect them against vaccine-preventable illnesses.&rdquo; Some ideas about how to tackle this problem include starting anti-retroviral therapy in infancy, before they are given their childhood vaccines, to preserve immunity to vaccine-preventable diseases. An alternative could be to re-vaccinate young children once they&rsquo;ve been on the therapy for a few years.</p><p>Another hot-button issue for this unique cohort is that of drug resistance. Kingon, who inherited Ledlie&rsquo;s cases in 2010 when she retired, finds her biggest challenge is getting her patients to adhere to their drug regimes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Adolescents are always going to do what they want to do. If you order them around, they&rsquo;ll either get fed up and leave or they&rsquo;ll &lsquo;yes&rsquo; you to death,&rdquo; says Kingon. When adolescents become lax about their treatment, it can have serious medical repercussions. Skipping HIV meds gives the virus an opportunity to start multiplying rapidly again and to develop drug resistance.</p><p>The daily medications have always been Tanya&rsquo;s biggest challenge. Taking your life-saving medication may seem like a straightforward and obvious thing to do for someone in her position, but taking &ldquo;meds&rdquo; is not just a simple case of popping a pill once a day. There are more than 20 different drugs approved for the treatment of HIV in the US and Europe. Many patients take a combination of drugs, often two or three at a time, to reduce the likelihood of developing resistance and make treatment more effective. In the past, HIV-positive people used to take as many as 30 pills a day. Although things have improved so that many of the drugs are combined into a single pill, some patients may still need to swallow a tablet two or four times a day. Even after her mother died of Aids and substance abuse in 2004, Tanya didn&rsquo;t stick to her regime, says Ledlie. Together, Ledlie and Tanya worked on a week-to-week schedule. &ldquo;I would call her and ask her to do good just for a week,&rdquo; says Ledlie.</p><p>Although Ledlie is not Tanya&rsquo;s physician anymore, she can&rsquo;t seem to shake that role. &ldquo;Have you been taking your meds?&rdquo; she asks casually. Tanya shakes her head, but insists that she knows she should. &ldquo;I know you know,&rdquo; Ledlie says, holding Tanya&rsquo;s gaze for an extra beat. Tanya says she realises the dangers of drug resistance and is ready to change her attitude - particularly if she wants to have kids someday. &ldquo;I hear Susan&rsquo;s voice in my head all the time when I walk past my meds on my dresser,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting older and I want to change before it&rsquo;s too late.&rdquo;</p><p>The need for holistic medical care like Ledlie&rsquo;s is becoming obsolete in the west. The sick helpless babies who have survived HIV infection are now independent grown-ups who need to transition safely into adult HIV healthcare. &ldquo;These children - I still call them that, though they aren&rsquo;t - they really are the pioneers,&rdquo; says Siberry. He says it&rsquo;s important for the medical community to stay in touch with this generation to see how their bodies and minds respond to the virus and the medications through adulthood. &ldquo;For their sakes, but also for younger children who will be following them in future decades.&rdquo;</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook page</a> or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:48Z","HeadlineLong":"Generation HIV: Growing up under a shadow of infection","HeadlineShort":"Generation HIV","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Pioneering young adults who have battled the infection since birth are giving scientists the first ever chance to understand what growing up with the virus really means. \n","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Pioneering young adults who have battled the infection since birth offer a first chance to understand what growing up with the virus really means.

But like so many other fun activities, it carries its fair share of risks. Unwanted pregnancies and getting a nasty disease are the obvious ones, but there is also the risk of having a heart attack, getting injured when the bed collapses, even the chance of arrest <em>in flagrante </em>in a public place.</p><p>So, what appears to be a simple act (for some, at least) is actually rather more complex. And that means we can begin to look for juicy numbers to find out just how risky things are in the bedroom.</p><p>Let us start, as most of us did, with simple, unprotected sex between a man and a woman, and ask: what is the chance of it ending in a pregnancy? This, for understandable reasons, is rather difficult to study under laboratory conditions &ndash; a New Zealand study in which participants were only allowed to have sex once a month suffered, unsurprisingly, with a high dropout rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the closest we have to a robust figure is from <a href=\"http://www.demographic-research.org/Volumes/Vol3/5/default.htm\">a European study</a> that recruited 782 young couples who did not use artificial contraception and who carefully recorded the day of every act (and there were a lot of them) until there had been 487 pregnancies. The simplest way to estimate the chance of pregnancy was to consider only cycles in which there had been only one act of intercourse. Peak times for pregnancies seemed to occur two days before ovulation &ndash; the chances of getting pregnant during this time was around 25%, confirming previous estimates. But the chances drop fairly steeply either side of the peak, to a 5% average over the rest of the cycle.</p><p>The bottom line is that a single act of intercourse between a young couple has on average a one in 20 chance of pregnancy &ndash; this assumes the opportunity presented itself on a random day, as these things tend do when you are young.</p><p><strong>Calculating success</strong></p><p>So, given this, what are the chances of success for an average couple trying to have a child? People who study how populations change are called demographers, and they use the rather academic term to describe the chances of becoming pregnant during one menstrual cycle: &ldquo;fecundability&rdquo;.</p><p>This, of course, varies between couples, but the estimated average is between 15% and 30% in high-income countries. Taking this lower figure we can estimate that for an average couple trying to have a child, there is an 85% chance of finishing each month without conceiving. If we assume each month is the same and independent, then there is a 0.85 x 0.85 (multiplied 12 times) chance of not getting pregnant in a year of trying, which is 14%.</p><p>So, in other words, fecundability of 15% means a 100 &ndash; 14 = 86% chance of getting pregnant in a year. A figure of 90% is often quoted as the proportion of young couples who will be expecting a child after a year without contraception, which corresponds to a fecundability of 18%.</p><p><strong>Reducing risk</strong></p><p>But suppose you do not actually want to get pregnant &ndash; how effective are different types of contraception?</p><p>This is generally expressed as pregnancy rate following one year of use, and strongly depends, of course, on the care with which precautions are taken.&nbsp; Devices such as the contraceptive pill, intrauterine devices, implants and injections are quoted as being 99% effective, so that less than 1 in 100 users should be pregnant after a year. Male condoms are around 98% effective if used correctly. And diaphragms and caps with spermicide are said to be 92-96% effective, which means that between 4 and 8 women using them will <a href=\"http://www.nhs.uk/chq/Pages/825.aspx?CategoryID=117&amp;SubCategoryID=114\">end up pregnant each year</a>.</p><p>Such figures are particularly important when trying to minimise the incidence of unwanted teenage pregnancies. In 1998 in England 41,000 girls aged 15-17 conceived. That is 47 in every 1,000 girls, or 1 in every 21 &ndash; or to put it in more stark terms, one girl in every average-sized school class. The UK government&rsquo;s efforts to halve this rate by 2010 only partially worked; by 2009 the headline figure had dropped to 38 per 1,000 girls, a 19% drop instead of their 50% target.</p><p>Forty-nine percent of these teenage pregnancies end in abortions, but that still leaves many actual teenage births. In a <a href=\"http://www.unicef-irc.org/publications/328\">2001 UNICEF report</a>, the UK had the highest rates in Europe with 30 births per women aged 15 to 19, with only the USA exceeding it among high-income OECD countries, with 52 births per 1,000. This is in staggering contrast to countries such as Korea, Japan, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Sweden, which all have birth rates of fewer than seven per 1,000 teenagers.

But do other animals dream? On that the Greek philosopher also had an opinion. In <a href=\"http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/history_anim.mb.txt\">The History of Animals</a>, he wrote: \"It would appear that not only do men dream, but horses also, and dogs, and oxen; aye, and sheep, and goats, and all viviparous quadrupeds; and dogs show their dreaming by barking in their sleep.\" His research methods may lack sophistication, but Aristotle may not have been too far off the mark.</p><p>We certainly can't ask animals if they dream, but we can at least observe the evidence that they might. There are two ways in which scientists have gone about this seemingly impossible task. One is to look at their physical behaviour during the various phases of the sleep cycle. The second is to see whether their sleeping brains work similarly to our own sleeping brains.</p><p>The story of how we worked out how to peer into the minds of sleeping animals begins in the 1960s. Back then, scattered reports began to appear in medical journals describing people acting out movements in their dreams. This was curious, because during so-called REM sleep (rapid eye movement), our muscles are usually paralysed.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01xvfn9\"}}</p><p>Researchers realised that inducing <a href=\"http://www.architalbiol.org/index.php/aib/article/viewArticle/418\">a similar state in animals</a> could allow them to probe how they dream. In 1965, French scientists Michel Jouvet and J F Delorme found that removing a part of the brainstem, called the pons, from a cat's brain prevented it becoming paralysed when in REM. The researchers called the condition \"REM without atonia\" or REM-A. Instead of lying still, the cats walked around and behaved aggressively.</p><p>This hinted they were dreaming of activities from their waking hours. And studies since have revealed similar behaviour. According to veterinary neurologist Adrian Morrison, who has written <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2869.1993.tb00052.x/abstract\">a review of this research</a>, cats in REM-A will move their heads as if following stimuli. Some cats also show behaviour identical to predatory attacks, as if they were chasing mice in their dreams. Similar dream activity has been seen in dogs.</p><p>Some humans have been found to &lsquo;act out&rsquo; their dreams too &ndash; if they suffer from a condition called REM Sleep Behaviour Disorder. \"Punching, kicking, leaping, and running from the bed during attempted dream enactment are frequent manifestations and usually correlate with the reported imagery,\" according to the <a href=\"http://www.esst.org/adds/ICSD.pdf\">International Classification of Sleep Disorders</a> (ICSD). Injuries are common among these people and those sleeping with them, the ICSD adds.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01xvfn0\"}}</p><p>Physical movement is not the only way of peering into dreams, though. Researchers can now humanely peer into the electrical and chemical activities of brain cells in animals while they sleep. In 2007, MIT scientists Kenway Louise and Matthew Wilson recorded the activity of neurons in a part of the rat brain called the hippocampus, a structure known to be involved in the formation and encoding of memories. They first recorded the activity of those brain cells while the rats ran in their mazes. Then they looked at the activity of the very same neurons while they slept. Louise and Wilson discovered identical patterns of firing during running and during REM. In other words, it was as if the rats were running the maze in their minds while they were snoozing. The results were so clear that the researchers could infer the rats' precise location within their mental dream mazes and map them to actual spots within the actual maze.</p><p>University of Chicago biologists Amish Dave and Daniel Margoliash <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/290/5492/812.short\">looked into the brains of zebra finches</a> and discovered something similar. These birds are not born with the melodies of their songs hardwired into the brains; instead, they have to learn to sing their songs. When they're awake, the neurons in part of the finches' forebrain called the robutus archistriatalis fire following their singing of particular notes. Researchers can determine which note was sung based on the firing patterns of those neurons. By piecing together the electrical patterns in those neurons over time, Dave and Margoliash can reconstruct the entire song from start to finish.</p><p>Later, when the birds were asleep, Dave and Margoliash looked again at the electrical activity in that part of their brains. The firing of those neurons wasn't entirely random. Instead, the neurons fired in order, as if the bird was audibly singing the song, note for note. It might be said that the zebra finches were practising their songs while they slumbered.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01xvfmv\"}}</p><p>Does the behaviour of cats in science experiments actually qualify as dreaming? Do rats have any subjective awareness that they're running their mazes in their minds while they nap? Do the songbirds realise that they're singing in their sleep? These questions are as hard to answer as the question of consciousness. It's tricky. We humans do not usually realise we're dreaming while we're dreaming, but it becomes clear as soon as we wake up. Do zebra finches remember their dreams <em>as dreams</em> when they're shaken out of their sleep? Can they distinguish the real world from the one in their dreams? We can say with a reasonable amount of certainty that the physiological and behavioural features of dreaming in humans have now been observed in cats, rats, birds, and other animals. Yet what it&rsquo;s actually like to experience a dream if you&rsquo;re not human remains a mystery.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Our animal behaviour uncovered.

It's a strange box because you can listen to absolutely everything going on around you, yet your voice cannot be heard. In fact, the box fits so tightly around your face and lips that you can't speak, or make a noise. At first, this feels like a game. Then reality sets in. You see and hear your family lamenting your fate. You're too cold. Then too hot. You're always thirsty. The visits of your friends and family dwindle. Your partner moves on. And there's nothing you can do about it.\"</p><p>Owen and I are talking on Skype. I&rsquo;m sitting in London, UK, and he&rsquo;s in another London three-and-a-half thousand miles away at the University of Western Ontario, Canada. Owen&rsquo;s reddish hair and close-cropped beard loom large on my screen as he becomes animated describing the torment of those with no voice: his patients.</p><p>People in a &ldquo;vegetative state&rdquo; are awake yet unaware. Their eyes can open and sometimes wander. They can smile, grasp another&rsquo;s hand, cry, groan or grunt. But they are indifferent to a hand clap, unable to see or to understand speech. Their motions are not purposeful but reflexive. They appear to have shed their memories, emotions and intentions, those qualities that make each one of us an individual. Their minds remain firmly shut. Still, when their eyelids flutter open, you are always left wondering if there&rsquo;s a glimmer of consciousness.</p><p>A decade ago, the answer would have been a bleak and emphatic no. Not any longer. Using brain scanners, Owen has found that some may be trapped inside their bodies yet able to think and feel to varying extents. The number of patients with disorders of consciousness has soared in recent decades, ironically, because doctors have steadily got better at saving patients with catastrophic injuries.</p><p>Today, trapped, damaged and diminished minds inhabit clinics and nursing homes worldwide &ndash; in Europe alone the number of new coma cases is estimated to be around 230,000 annually, of which some 30,000 will languish in a persistent vegetative state. They are some of the most tragic and expensive artefacts of modern intensive care.</p><p>Owen knows this only too well. In 1997, a close friend set off on her usual cycle to work. Anne [name changed] had a weak spot on a blood vessel in her head, known as a brain aneurysm. Five minutes into her trip, the aneurysm burst and she crashed into a tree. She never regained consciousness.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01xsk6d\"}}</p><p>The tragedy left Owen numb, yet Anne&rsquo;s accident would shape the rest of his life. He began to wonder if there was a way to determine which of these patients were in an unconscious coma, which were conscious and which were somewhere in between?</p><p>That year, he had moved to the Medical Research Council&rsquo;s Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit in Cambridge, where researchers used various scanning techniques. One, positron emission tomography (PET), highlights different metabolic processes in the brain, such as oxygen and sugar use. Another, known as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), can reveal active centres in the brain by detecting the tiny surges in blood flow that take place as a mind whirrs. Owen wondered whether he could use these technologies to reach out to patients, like his friend, stuck between sensibility and oblivion.</p><p><strong>Conscious decision</strong></p><p>Half a century ago, if your heart stopped beating you could be pronounced dead even though you may have been entirely conscious as the doctor sent you to the morgue. This, in all likelihood, could explain notorious accounts through history of those who &lsquo;came back from the dead&rsquo;. As recently as 2011, a council in the Malatya province of central Turkey announced it had built a morgue with a warning system and refrigerator doors that could be opened from the inside.</p><p>The problem is that the scientific definition of &ldquo;death&rdquo; remains as unresolved as the definition of &ldquo;consciousness&rdquo;. Being alive is no longer linked to having a beating heart, explains Owen. If I have an artificial heart, am I dead? If you are on a life-support machine, are you dead? Is a failure to sustain independent life a reasonable definition of death? No, otherwise we would all be &ldquo;dead&rdquo; in the nine months before birth.</p><p>The issue becomes murkier when we consider those trapped in the twilight worlds between normal life and death &ndash; from those who slip in and out of awareness, who are trapped in a &lsquo;minimally conscious state&rsquo;, to those who are severely impaired in a vegetative state or a coma. These patients first appeared in the wake of the development of the artificial respirator during the 1950s in Denmark, an invention that redefined the end of life in terms of the idea of brain death and created the specialty of intensive care, in which unresponsive and comatose patients who seemed unable to wake up again were written off as &ldquo;vegetables&rdquo; or &ldquo;jellyfish&rdquo;. As is always the case when treating patients, definitions are critical: understanding the chances of recovery, the benefits of treatments and so on all depend on a precise diagnosis.</p><p>In the 1960s, neurologist Fred Plum in New York and neurosurgeon Bryan Jennett in Glasgow carried out pioneering work to understand and categorise disorders of consciousness. Plum coined the term &ldquo;locked-in syndrome&rdquo;, in which a patient is aware and awake but cannot move or talk. With Plum, Jennett devised the Glasgow Coma Scale to rate the depth of coma, and Jennett followed up with the Glasgow Outcome Scale to weigh up the extent of recovery, from death to mild disability. Together they adopted the term &ldquo;persistent vegetative state&rdquo; for patients who, they wrote, &ldquo;have periods of wakefulness when their eyes are open and move; their responsiveness is limited to primitive postural and reflex movements of the limbs, and they never speak.&rdquo;</p><p>In 2002, Jennett was among a group of neurologists who chose the phrase &ldquo;minimally conscious&rdquo; to describe those who are sometimes awake and partly aware, who show erratic signs of consciousness so that at one time they might be able to follow a simple instruction and another they might not. Even today, however, we&rsquo;re still arguing over who is conscious and who isn&rsquo;t. &nbsp;</p><p><strong>Revealing scan</strong></p><p>Kate Bainbridge, a 26-year-old schoolteacher, lapsed into a coma three days after she came down with a flu-like illness. Her brain became inflamed, along with the primitive region atop the spinal cord, the brain stem, which rules the sleep cycle. A few weeks after her infection had cleared, Kate awoke from the coma but was diagnosed as being in a vegetative state. Luckily, the intensive care doctor responsible for her, David Menon, was also a Principal Investigator at the newly opened Wolfson Brain Imaging Centre in Cambridge, where one Adrian Owen then worked.</p><p>In 1997, four months after she had been diagnosed as vegetative, Kate became the first patient in a vegetative state to be studied by the Cambridge group. The results, published in 1998, were unexpected and extraordinary. Not only did Kate react to faces: but her brain responses were indistinguishable from those of healthy volunteers. Her scans revealed a splash of red, marking brain activity at the back of her brain, in a part called the fusiform gyrus, which helps recognise faces. Kate became the first such patient in whom sophisticated brain imaging (in this case PET) revealed &ldquo;covert cognition&rdquo;. Of course, whether that response was a reflex or a signal of consciousness was, at the time, a matter of debate.</p><p>The results were of huge significance for science but also for Kate and her parents. &ldquo;The existence of preserved cognitive processing removed the nihilism that pervaded the management of such patients in general, and supported a decision to continue to treat Kate aggressively,&rdquo; recalls Menon.</p><p>Kate eventually surfaced from her ordeal, six months after the initial diagnosis. &ldquo;They said I could not feel pain,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They were so wrong.&rdquo; Sometimes she&rsquo;d cry out, but the nurses thought it was just a reflex. She felt abandoned and helpless. Hospital staff had no idea how much she suffered in their care. Kate found physiotherapy scary: nurses never explained what they were doing to her. She was terrified when they removed mucus from her lungs. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you how frightening it was, especially suction through the mouth,&rdquo; she has written. At one point, her pain and despair became so much that she tried to snuff out her life by holding her breath.&nbsp;&ldquo;I could not stop my nose from breathing, so it did not work. My body did not seem to want to die.&rdquo;</p><p>Kate says her recovery was not so much like turning a light on but a gradual awakening. It took her five months before she could smile. By then she had lost her job, her sense of smell and taste, and much of what might have been a normal future. Now back with her parents, Kate is still very disabled and needs a wheelchair. Twelve years after her illness, she started to talk again and, though still angry about the way she was treated when she was at her most vulnerable, she remains grateful to those who helped her mind to escape.</p><p>She sent Owen a note.</p><blockquote><p>Dear Adrian,Please use my case to show people how important the scans are. I want more people to know about them. I am a big fan of them now. I was unresponsive and looked hopeless, but the scan showed people I was in there. It was like magic, it found me. </p></blockquote><p>In a forested campus south of Liege, Steven Laureys studies vegetative patients in research that dates back decades. Working there as part of the Cyclotron Research Centre in the 1990s, he was surprised when PET brain scans revealed that the patients could respond to a mention of their own name: meaningful sounds produced a change in blood flow within the auditory primary cortices. Meanwhile, on the other side of the Atlantic, Nicholas Schiff was finding that within catastrophically injured brains lay partially working regions, clusters of remnant neural activity. What did it all mean?</p><p><strong>Anyone for tennis?</strong></p><p>At that time, doctors thought they already knew the answers: no patient in a persistent vegetative state was conscious. Never mind that staring at images made the brain light up, they carped: you can do that in a sedated monkey. Based on previous experience, a brain starved of oxygen as a result of a heart attack or a stroke was unlikely to recover if it didn&rsquo;t in the first few months. These patients had suffered a fate that many people regarded as worse than death itself: they were functionally brainless. Undead. Doctors, with the best intentions, thought it was perfectly acceptable to end the life of a vegetative patient by starvation and the withdrawal of water. This was the age of what Laureys calls &ldquo;therapeutic nihilism&rdquo;.</p><p>What Owen, Laureys and Schiff were proposing was a rethink of some of the patients who were considered vegetative. A few of them could even be classed as being fully conscious and locked-in. The establishment was doggedly opposed. &ldquo;You cannot imagine the environment in the late 1990s,&rdquo; says Schiff. &ldquo;The hostility we encountered went well beyond simple scepticism&rdquo;. Looking back, Laureys pauses and smiles thinly: &ldquo;Medical doctors do not like to be told they are wrong.&rdquo;</p><p>Then came 2006. Owen and Laureys were trying to find a reliable way to communicate with patients in a vegetative state, including Gillian [name changed]. In July 2005, this 23-year-old had been crossing a road, chatting on her mobile phone. She was struck by two cars.</p><p>Five months later, a strange stroke of serendipity allowed Gillian to unlock her box. The key arose from a systematic study Owen started with Laureys in 2005. They had asked healthy volunteers to imagine doing different things, from singing songs or conjuring up the face of their mother. Then Owen had another idea. &ldquo;I just had a hunch,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I asked a healthy control to imagine playing tennis. Then I asked her to imagine walking through the rooms of her house.&rdquo; Imagining tennis activates part of the cortex, called the supplementary motor area, involved in the mental simulation of movements. But imagining walking around the house activates the parahippocampal gyrus in the core of the brain, the posterior parietal lobe, and the lateral premotor cortex. The two patterns of activity were as distinct as a &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and a &lsquo;no&rsquo;. So, if people were asked to imagine tennis for &lsquo;yes&rsquo; and walking around the house for &lsquo;no&rsquo;, they could answer questions via fMRI.</p><p>Gazing into Gillian&rsquo;s &lsquo;vegetative&rsquo; brain with the brain scanner, he asked her to imagine the same things &ndash; and saw strikingly similar activation patterns to the healthy volunteers. It was an electric moment. Owen could read her mind.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01xskr4\"}}</p><p>Gillian&rsquo;s case, published in the journal Science in 2006, made front-page headlines around the world. The result provoked wonder and, of course, disbelief. &ldquo;Broadly speaking, I received two types of email from my peers,&rdquo; says Owen. &ldquo;They either said &lsquo;This is amazing &ndash; well done!&rsquo; or &lsquo;How could you possibly say this woman is conscious?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>As the old saw goes, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. The sceptics countered that it was wrong to make these &ldquo;radical inferences&rdquo; when there could be a more straightforward interpretation. Daniel Greenberg, a psychologist at the University of California, Los Angeles, suggested that &ldquo;the brain activity was unconsciously triggered by the last word of the instructions, which always referred to the item to be imagined.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Put to the test</strong></p><p>Parashkev Nachev, a neurologist now at University College London, says he objected to Owen&rsquo;s 2006 paper not on grounds of implausibility or a flawed statistical analysis but because of &ldquo;errors of inference&rdquo;. Although a conscious brain, when imagining tennis, triggers a certain pattern of activation, it does not necessarily mean that the same pattern of activation signifies consciousness. The same brain area can be activated in many circumstances, Nachev says, with or without any conscious correlate. Moreover, he argues that Gillian was not really offered a true choice to think about playing tennis. Just as a lack of response could be because of an inability to respond or a decision not to cooperate, a direct response to a simple instruction could be a conscious decision or a reflex.</p><p>What is needed is less philosophising and more data, says Owen. A follow-up study published in 2010 by Owen, Laureys and colleagues tested 54 patients with a clinical diagnosis of being in a vegetative state or a minimally conscious state; five responded in the same way as Gillian. Four of them were supposedly in a vegetative state at admission. Owen, Schiff and Laureys have explored alternative explanations of what they observed and, for example, acknowledge that the brain areas they study when they interrogate patients can be activated in other ways. But the 2010 paper ruled out such automatic behaviours as an explanation, they say: the activations persist too long to signify anything other than intent. Owen is grateful to his critics. They spurred him on, for instance to develop a method for asking patients questions that only they would know how to answer. &ldquo;You cannot communicate unconsciously &ndash; it is just not possible,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We have won that argument&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Owen&rsquo;s 2006 <em>Science</em> paper, studies in Belgium, the UK, the US and Canada suggest that a significant proportion of patients who were classified as vegetative in recent years have been misdiagnosed &ndash; Owen estimates perhaps as many as 20%. Schiff, who weighs up the extent of misdiagnosis a different way, goes further. Based on recent studies, he says around 40% of patients thought to be vegetative are, when examined more closely, partly aware. Among this group of supposedly vegetative patients are those who are revealed by scanners to be able to communicate and should be diagnosed as locked-in, if they are fully conscious, or minimally conscious, if their abilities wax and wane.</p><p>In 2009, Laurey&rsquo;s team asked one of the original group of 54 patients that he and Owen had studied &ndash; patient 23 &ndash; a series of yes-or-no questions. It was the usual drill: imagine playing tennis for yes, navigating the house for no. The Liege patient, who had been in a vegetative state for five years, was able to answer five of six questions about his earlier life &ndash; and all of those were correct. Had he been on holiday to a certain place prior to his injury? Was such-and-such his father&rsquo;s name? It was an exciting moment, said Laureys. &ldquo;We were stunned,&rdquo; adds Owen, who helped independently score the tests. &ldquo;By showing us that he was conscious and aware, patient 23 moved himself from the &lsquo;do not resuscitate&rsquo; category to the &lsquo;not allowed to die&rsquo; category. Did we save his life? No. He saved his own life.&rdquo;</p><p>Nachev has not changed his view since he first criticised Owen&rsquo;s work and has spelt out the basis of his unease in a more detailed paper published in 2010. &ldquo;For every relative of a living PVS [persistent vegetative state] patient given (probably false) hope, another is burdened with the guilt of having acquiesced in the withdrawal of treatment from someone who &ndash; he has been led to believe &ndash; may have been more alive than it seemed,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There are moral costs to false positives as well as to false negatives.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>&ldquo;I find the whole media circus surrounding the issue rather distasteful,&rdquo; he told me. &ldquo;The relatives of these patients are distressed enough as it is.&rdquo;</p><p>Laureys, Owen and Schiff spend a great deal of time with the families and understand these sensitivities only too well. Owen counters that, from his years of experience dealing with the families, they are grateful that doctors and scientists take an interest and are doing everything that they can. &ldquo;These patients have been shortchanged over the years,&rdquo; he insists.</p><p>Owen is adamant that doctors have a moral duty to provide a correct diagnosis, even if the results do cause guilt, unease or distress. &ldquo;We must give every patient the best chance of an accurate diagnosis, so we can give them the appropriate care that goes along with that diagnosis.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Mind limitations</strong></p><p>The art of mind reading is constantly being refined. Owen and Lorina Naci have come up with a more reliable way to communicate with patients by getting them to focus their attention while in the scanner. First, a yes/no question is asked, and then a recording is played of the word &ldquo;yes&rdquo; repeated several times interspersed with distracting, random numbers, and a similar recording with &ldquo;no&rdquo;. The participant has to count how many of the correct answer they hear and ignore the incorrect answer. This mental effort (selective auditory attention) shows up distinctively when Naci and Owen examine the brain scans, so they can decode the responses correctly based on activity changes within the attention network of the brain. In follow-up studies using this method, Scott Routley showed he knew his own name, as distinct from another, and that he was in a hospital rather than elsewhere, indicating he possessed a higher level of self-awareness.</p><p>Yet there are many issues left to resolve. After the initial diagnosis, relatively little effort is made to systematically explore brain function in these patients, says Schiff. There are also minimally conscious patients who may not be able to imagine tennis and so on, when a few exceptional vegetative patients can. Other limitations are caused by the use of medication during trials or the huge diversity of the patients that are usually collapsed into groups (to spare doctors from carrying out the same procedures on the same patient again and again). And when it comes to younger patients, there is a limit to the number of PET scans they can have in a given period because a radioactive tracer has to be injected into the body.</p><p>Then there is the fact that huge, multimillion-dollar imaging machines &ndash; confining and magnetic &ndash; are unsuitable for patients whose bodies are affected by spasticity or have been rebuilt with screws, plates, pins and other metal. But more convenient alternatives are in development. Laureys is studying pupil dilation, which is linked with thought (the wider the pupil, the higher a patient&rsquo;s emotional arousal, while more subtle dilations have been linked to mental functions such as decision making). Another method implants fine electrodes in the hand of a patient to measure &ldquo;sub-threshold&rdquo; muscle activity triggered when they are asked to move.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps the most promising alternative is electroencephalography (EEG), which detects crackles of electrical activity in the brain through electrodes attached to the scalp. This is cheap, relatively portable and fast (with milliseconds of lag, compared with 8 seconds for fMRI), meaning that a research team can ask up to 200 questions in 30 minutes. This method can also cope with patients who twitch and move, or who have been reconstructed with implants. &ldquo;This is a vulnerable patient population, and moving them is never easy,&rdquo; says Owen, whose team have equipped a jeep. &ldquo;We pack our gear in our &lsquo;EEJeep&rsquo; and visit them instead.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01xskcr\"}}</p><p>Schiff&rsquo;s team is sceptical whether one particular EEG methodology used with the detector really works. &ldquo;One has to be careful of the dead salmon effect,&rdquo; admits Laureys, referring to an apparently frivolous study of a deceased fish that made a serious point about the limitations of fMRI. The methodology struggled to distinguish real brain activity from background &lsquo;noise&rsquo;, suggesting that the dead Atlantic salmon that had been put in the scanner was actually thinking. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want to get excited about dead fish,&rdquo; says Laureys, &ldquo;but, on other hand, we do not want to be so conservative and demanding of statistics that we miss things.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Illuminating the dark</strong></p><p>Today it is normal to think of the transition between life and death as a question of &ldquo;how the brain is&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;how the heart is.&rdquo; A patient in a persistent vegetative state still has a functioning brain stem and can breathe unaided. They may possess some degree of consciousness and have a slim chance of recovering. By comparison, a PET scan of a brain-dead person reveals a black void within the skull, a barren neural landscape with no chance of sparking back into activity again: their body cannot survive without artificial help.</p><p>Schiff believes that a combination of devices, drugs and cell therapies, laying the foundations for a new generation of diagnostics and treatments, will illuminate the penumbra between conscious and unconscious. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not quite there yet,&rdquo; he stresses. Much of the work to date has demonstrated the value of brain scans on populations of patients but, ultimately, they need dependable methods that will work on a patient-by-patient basis. &ldquo;We are going to have to do some amazing small-scale studies to show what is possible in one or two subjects before everyone gets simple things done that can help them today,&rdquo; Schiff says. Eventually, he believes there will be a &ldquo;cultural shift&rdquo;. Laureys thinks we may need to start with the language used to describe these patients &ndash; he wants to replace the loaded term &ldquo;vegetative&rdquo; with the neutral &ldquo;unresponsive wakefulness&rdquo;.</p><p>Despite the scepticism, the difficulties in dealing with such diverse groups of patients, and the challenges of standardising diagnosis, the research is moving forward. It is already making a difference, enabling a few patients to tell their doctors whether they need pain relief.&nbsp;</p><p>Back on Skype, Owen smiles, considering whether to tell me what he is planning next. Owen&rsquo;s partner, Jessica Grahn, also a neuroscientist, became pregnant at the start of 2013. What happens when consciousness winks on in the developing brain?</p><p>He emails me a video of their unborn child, a montage of fMRI slices through their baby&rsquo;s head, as it twists and turns in Jessica&rsquo;s womb. &ldquo;My colleagues have been doing fMRI on my wife&rsquo;s tummy every week for a few weeks now to see if we can activate the fetus&rsquo;s brain,&rdquo; he writes. &ldquo;It is AMAZING.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p><p><em>Scott Routley died in September 2013 with his family by his side.<br /> Adrian Owen&rsquo;s friend Anne remains in a vegetative state.<br /> Adrian Owen and Jessica Grahn&rsquo;s baby boy, Jackson, was born on 9 October 2013.</em></p><p><em>This is an edited version of an article originally published by Mosaic, and is reproduced under a Creative Commons licence.

By implanting tiny disc-shaped magnets in their fingers, they can feel the electromagnetic fields surrounding everyday technology. The falling price and wider availability of powerful neodymium magnets have made the procedure increasingly popular.</p><p>Peyton Rowlands is one such enthusiast, a Texas-based biohacker who implanted a magnet into the ring finger of his left hand. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t feel your finger getting pulled toward anything because the magnet is just so small,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;You feel a slight buzz once you get within a couple of inches of basically anything with electricity running through it.&rdquo; With the implant, Rowlands found he could detect the fields surrounding microwaves, refrigerators and power converters. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very interesting sensation, kind of crazy. One of the things that I noticed is that DC current often felt similar to a ferrous metal or another magnet, a static bubble pushing or pulling against you, as opposed to AC currents which were much more like the kind of pins and needles feeling people describe.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wzs1b\"}}</p><p>However, Rowlands suffered a reaction to the magnet and had to remove it. This is a relatively common risk with implants, and they need to be coated with some kind of biocompatible material to avoid being expelled by the body. However, even these coatings can cause a reaction, as Rowlands discovered. He&rsquo;s currently searching for a more tissue-friendly alternative.</p><p>Gaining an animal ability does not have to mean relying on technology. Daniel Kish lost his sight at the age of 13 months after suffering retinal blastoma, a form of cancer that affects the eyes. Within two months, his parents noticed he seemed to be able to navigate his environment and had a sense of what was around him. &ldquo;Echolocation is something I&rsquo;ve done for as long as I can remember,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The clicking of echolocation is used discreetly and strategically, so it isn&rsquo;t something that would necessarily be immediately obvious to my parents.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Bat man</strong></p><p>Quite on his own, Kish had learned to visualise the environment by clicking his tongue and listening to the reflected sounds. Echolocation is used by bats as well as cetaceans such as dolphins and whales to sense their environment. Kish identifies at least two kinds of echolocation he uses &ndash; the active clicking which he calls &ldquo;flash sonar&rdquo; (in reference to the illuminating flash of a camera), and passive echolocation which relies on paying careful attention to the acoustics of the immediate environment. Together, they form a small subset of the skills he uses to compensate for his lack of sight.</p><p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a misconception out there that you have to be gifted to develop this skill,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I would say that&rsquo;s not true. You get ranges of ability, but it really has most to do with the motivation one has and the opportunity to implement the skill.&rdquo;</p><p>Indeed, others are already following Kish, such as Sam Oldridge, a British boy who was echolocating by the time he was eight years old (see video, below). And as president of World Access for the Blind, Kish runs workshops to teach blind students how to echolocate as well receive proper cane training.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Blind-Boy-Sees-With-Sound-Echol\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;The brain is a very interesting mechanism, a massive adaptive mechanism,&rdquo; says Kish. But admits it&rsquo;s very difficult for a sighted person to learn echolocation, because they lack the motivating necessity. &ldquo;Learning echolocation is much easier than learning a language, I know as I&rsquo;ve done both,&rdquo; Kish laughs. &ldquo;And like a language if you don&rsquo;t use it daily, you lose it.&rdquo;</p><p>But could sighted people train their eyes to see further, better, clearer? Rowlands thinks so. Working as a researcher with Science for the Masses, a group that works on open-access scientific research outside of any academic institution, he is embarking on a self-experiment programme to augment his own eyes to see into the infra-red spectrum through diet alone.</p><p>The key is in the biology of the eye. The human retina predominately uses the molecules photopsin and rhodopsin to perceive light, while freshwater fish such as the Mozambique tilapia employ a different molecule, porphyropsin. This grants the tilapia a much greater sensitivity to deep reds, and allows them to see into the near infra-red (NIR) spectrum. Rowlands hopes that by avoiding retinol (Vitamin A) &ndash; the vital nutrient needed to produce photopsin and rhodopsin, he can force the body into using its less-preferred molecule, porphyropsin.</p><p>As crazy as it sounds, the experiment is not without precedent. During World War II, the US Navy tried a similar procedure to give its signalmen NIR vision. The goal was to allow ships to communicate via infra-red semaphore lamps, which the enemy would not be able to see. However, the advent of infra-red goggles killed the idea.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wzsmn\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;With this exploit, I&rsquo;m not seeing in the thermal range,&rdquo; warns Rowlands. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to give the impression we&rsquo;re talking about &lsquo;Predator vision&rsquo;&rdquo;. However, if successful, the augment will allow him to see more clearly, as NIR light has an easier time passing through smog and dust. &ldquo;I would have a longer range of vision, potentially I would see a lot further out on the horizon than anyone else,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;The same thing goes for sunglasses and tinted car windows, I&rsquo;ll be able to see through these things a lot easier.&rdquo; Rowlands says he might also find he can see the lights emitted by security night cameras and TV remotes, and even see through certain clothing materials.</p><p>Clearly the plan comes with risks. Withholding essential nutrients from the body can be harmful, which is why Rowlands and the other experimenters have designed a specially-designed nutrient shake containing supplements designed to counteract some of the risks. The fact that Rowlands&rsquo; group is working outside university science, without any of the usual qualifications, may raise some eyebrows. But he&rsquo;s determined to prove that science can exist outside of academia, by following the scientific method and using established experimental protocols. They&rsquo;ll find out if it works after a three-month-long trial, beginning soon.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to look at the animal kingdom and feel in awe of the incredible feats on display. But both Rowlands and Kish warn that humans shouldn&rsquo;t be underestimated. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t pre-suppose restrictions on any individual,&rdquo; says Kish. &ldquo;Judging by the ease with which I can train someone to use a cane and flash sonar suggests that the ability is [already] there, it just needs to be activated. It&rsquo;s quite rusty, but it&rsquo;s there.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no doubt that our brains provide us with imagination and innovation that no other creature can match &ndash; replicating unusual animal abilities might just be another of our resulting talents. How's that for a superpower?</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","HeadlineLong":"The people with ‘animal powers’","HeadlineShort":"The people with ‘animal powers’","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"By augmenting their bodies and minds to acquire animal-like abilities, some people are trying to sense a world that most humans cannot experience, says Frank Swain.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"By augmenting their bodies to acquire animal-like abilities, some people are trying to sense a world that most humans cannot experience, says Frank Swain","SummaryShort":"Sensing a world most humans cannot see","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"f179f268-d402-4c92-899c-b1cf6c1cfa4b","Id":"wwfuture/story/20140407-the-people-with-animal-powers","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20140407-the-people-with-animal-powers"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20140407-the-people-with-animal-powers","_id":"55dc6388e2b83951eb997a1f"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>In February 1935, the year of King George V&rsquo;s Silver Jubilee, a chimpanzee at London Zoo called Boo-Boo <a href=\"http://www.britishpathe.com/video/just-boo-boos-baby\">gave birth to a baby daughter</a>. A couple of months later, a little blonde-haired girl was given a soft-toy replica of the zoo&rsquo;s new arrival to mark her first birthday. This was Jane Goodall&rsquo;s first recorded encounter with a chimp.</p><p>Goodall turns 80 this week<em>. </em>In the intervening years, her research on a community of chimpanzees in Tanzania revolutionised our understanding of these primates, our closest living relatives, and challenged deepset ideas of what it means to be human. She then packed in her fieldwork to become an activist, campaigning tirelessly for a more enlightened attitude towards animals and the environment. Along the way she has <a href=\"http://www.janegoodall.org/sites/default/files/images/Jane%20Goodall%27s%20Curriculum%20Vitae.pdf\">received nearly 50 honorary degrees</a>, and became a UN Messenger of Peace in 2002 and Dame Jane in 2004.</p><p>Though I have only crossed London to meet her, I am struck by the sudden feeling that I have reached the end of some epic, Henry Stanley-like quest&hellip; &ldquo;Dr Goodall?&rdquo; As I reach out to shake a slender hand, the words &ldquo;I presume&rdquo; pop into my head. I suppress them.</p><p>I follow her into the front room and she politely offers me tea or coffee. There is a sofa beneath the bay window and next to it &ndash; as if only just put aside &ndash; a large book. I pick up <a href=\"http://articles.latimes.com/1986-12-28/books/bk-741_1_jane-goodall\">The Chimpanzees of Gombe: Patterns of Behavior</a>, Goodall&rsquo;s magnum opus published in 1986. I flip through its characterful portraits of the Gombe chimps, many of them &ndash; like David Greybeard &ndash; now household names.</p><p>Goodall sits down neatly on the sofa with her back to the bright sun. This is a brief pause in her whirlwind travel schedule of more than 300 days a year, but she displays few signs of weariness &ndash; worldly or otherwise. She has just been going through proofs of her updated book Seeds of Hope, the first edition of which was troubled by allegations of plagiarism. I don&rsquo;t want to broach the subject so early in the interview; I ask instead about her childhood, which I sense is of great importance to understanding Goodall.</p><p>Having seen a photograph of that doting little girl clutching <a href=\"http://www.lessonsforhope.org/scrapbook1.asp?sec=2&amp;pgid=21\">Jubilee</a>, her somewhat scruffy birthday chimp, I love the idea that this fluffy character influenced what Goodall would go on to achieve. On this, however, she sets me straight. When she first ventured to Africa in 1957, Goodall says, it had never occurred to her to work with chimpanzees. Rather, she had a far less specific and more romantic dream inspired by fictional characters from the books she had read as a child, notably Dr Dolittle and Tarzan. &ldquo;I never wanted to be a scientist per se,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I wanted to be a naturalist.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0hp\"}}</p><p>Goodall tells a story from her childhood that demonstrates how fixated she was by the Africa of her imagination. As a special treat, her mother, Vanne, had taken her to the cinema to see her first Tarzan film. When the curtains drew back to reveal Johnny Weissmuller in the starring role, however, the young Goodall burst into a fit of hysterical tears. In the quiet of the foyer, she composed herself and told her mother firmly: &ldquo;That is <em>not</em> Tarzan.&rdquo;</p><p>When she describes her earliest experiences of Africa, however, they don&rsquo;t sound all that different from the jungles of her dreams. Not long after arriving in Kenya, Goodall captured the attention of <a href=\"http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990619,00.html\">Louis Leakey</a>, the eminent palaeoanthropologist and curator of the Coryndon Museum in Nairobi. Within hours of meeting, she had so impressed him with her knowledge of natural history that he had offered her a job. Within months, Leakey and his wife, Mary, set out on an expedition to Olduvai Gorge in what is now northern Tanzania, and Goodall went too. The place was teeming with wildlife.</p><p>&ldquo;There were lions and rhinos and giraffes &ndash; I mean, <em>everything </em>was there,&rdquo; she recalls with a flash of excitement. &ldquo;I often think that&rsquo;s one of the most magical times of my whole life.&rdquo;</p><p>It was while scouring this ancient landscape for evidence of early humans and other hominids that Leakey first mentioned the idea of establishing a complementary study on wild chimpanzees to the west, at the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve on the edge of Lake Tanganyika. Three years later, in 1960, Goodall entered the reserve to begin her research.</p><p>There had only ever been one concerted attempt to study chimps in the wild &ndash; and that scientist &ldquo;had a trail of 22 porters&rdquo;, Goodall says with a hint of pride in her voice. For the first few months in Gombe, it was just her, her mother and a single hired assistant. &ldquo;I wanted to be alone,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;but I wasn't allowed.&rdquo;</p><p>Goodall pauses, revisiting that period in her mind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget going along the shoreline of Lake Tanganyika, then looking up&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0jp\"}}</p><p>Up there, in the densely forested valleys that funnel streams off steep hills to the water&rsquo;s edge, were the chimpanzees she had come to study. With the assistance of a game warden who acted as escort, Goodall and her mother put up their ex-army tent. &ldquo;If you wanted air to come in, you just rolled up the sides and tied them with tape,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Well, the air came in, but the spiders, scorpions and snakes came in as well.&rdquo;</p><p>Although her mother was terrified &ndash; &ldquo;You know I&rsquo;m afraid of spiders!&rdquo; &ndash; Goodall was apparently fearless, setting off up the slopes to explore her new home. &ldquo;I sat up there and just couldn&rsquo;t imagine I was there. It seemed absolutely unreal.&rdquo;</p><p>The picture Goodall paints &ndash; a folding camp bed beside a palm tree in a forest clearing beneath a bright moon, the sound of baboons barking in the distance &ndash; could have come straight from an Edgar Rice Burroughs novel. I wonder if the realisation of so fantastical a childhood dream has helped her stay connected to her youth &ndash; but again she sets me straight. Rather it is The Birches, the home near Bournemouth in which she grew up: when not travelling, this is where Goodall still returns, to &ldquo;all my childhood books, the trees I climbed as a child, the cliffs where I walked&hellip; I am blessed in this way.&rdquo;</p><p>During her first stint in the field, Goodall struggled to get close to the chimps. However, the individual she named David Greybeard proved a particular inspiration, showing her a side to chimpanzees nobody had ever documented before. In late October 1960, she watched David from a distance as he gnawed away at the freshly killed corpse of what was probably a baby bush pig &ndash; an observation that ran counter to the then-widespread assumption that chimps were strict vegetarians.</p><p>A few days later, Goodall witnessed David making and using a tool to feed on ants. I ask her to describe this moment in detail: &ldquo;There was vegetation in the way and David had his back to me&hellip; so what I saw was the hand picking up the tool. I saw the movements. And I saw it was obvious he was eating&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>Once David had moved off, Goodall went to investigate and discovered long stalks of grass lying around. Picking a stalk up, she pushed it into one of the narrow entrance holes to the ant colony. The disturbance caused ants to emerge. The chimps, presumably, would then lick them off the grass. After subsequent, clearer sightings of this behaviour, Goodall went to Leakey with the discovery.</p><p>&ldquo;I knew it was very important because I&rsquo;d been around Leakey long enough,&rdquo; she says. At that point, most people believed humans were the only species capable of making and using tools. In response to Goodall&rsquo;s observations of David and others, Leakey famously declared: &ldquo;Now we must redefine &lsquo;tool&rsquo;, redefine &lsquo;man&rsquo;, or accept chimpanzees as humans.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0lf\"}}</p><p>I am suddenly aware that Goodall is watching me, back perfectly upright, hands in her lap. She keeps very still, her soft green eyes studying my face as she waits patiently for my next question. I feel a peculiar, strangely comforting empathy with David Greybeard and the other Gombe chimps.</p><p>Despite Leakey&rsquo;s excitement over Goodall&rsquo;s early findings, not everyone was ready to embrace them. In late 1961, she arrived in Cambridge, where Leakey had used his connections to enrol her for a doctorate &ndash; not something Goodall wanted to do. &ldquo;I was only doing this thesis for Leakey&rsquo;s sake. I&rsquo;d never had an ambition to be a scientist and be part of academia.&rdquo;</p><p>The patronising treatment Goodall received at the hands of her mainly male colleagues can hardly have endeared her to the academic lifestyle. She was criticised for giving her study-animals names and personalities. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t give them personalities, I merely described their personalities,&rdquo; she counters. As for Goodall&rsquo;s reported discovery that chimps used tools: &ldquo;Some scientists actually said I must have taught them.&rdquo; She laughs. &ldquo;That would have been fabulous if I could have done that.&rdquo;</p><p>I try to imagine receiving this kind of dismissive treatment, and suspect I would have been infuriated, then crushed. Not Goodall. She says she simply knew that she was right and her critics were wrong. I ask where this conviction came from and, as an explanation, she returns to her youth.</p><p>&ldquo;My mother always taught us that if people don&rsquo;t agree with you, the important thing is to listen to them. But if you&rsquo;ve listened to them carefully and you still think that you&rsquo;re right, then you must have the courage of your convictions.&rdquo;</p><p>So when her Cambridge colleagues told her she couldn&rsquo;t talk about chimps having personality, mind and emotion, she begged to differ &ndash; because of Rusty the black mongrel. &ldquo;Rusty had taught me otherwise. If you spend time with animals, you&rsquo;re not going to betray them by taking away something which is theirs.&rdquo;</p><p>Rusty, I discover, was one of two dogs with whom Goodall became friendly in her early teens at The Birches. The other, Budleigh, was a beautiful long-haired collie belonging to the owner of the local sweetshop. &ldquo;Collies are meant to be bright but he wasn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Goodall says, recalling how Budleigh proved incapable of learning to shake hands.</p><p>One day, though, as Goodall continued her efforts to train &ldquo;Buds&rdquo;, Rusty the mongrel (watching at a distance) raised his paw. &ldquo;From that moment I realised Rusty was brilliantly intelligent because, even though I wasn&rsquo;t teaching him, he&rsquo;d learned by observing my teaching of Buds.&rdquo;</p><p>I am struck by what Goodall did next. The young teenager imagined herself inside Rusty&rsquo;s mind, she says, in an effort to see the world from his perspective and relive the intellectual feat he&rsquo;d just performed. There are not many children I know who&rsquo;d do this, I suggest. She considers for a moment: &ldquo;Probably not.&rdquo;</p><p>If her Cambridge colleagues had been patronising, it was nothing compared to the treatment she received at a symposium on primates held at the Zoological Society of London in April 1962. &ldquo;I gave my first scientific presentation and was terrified, says Goodall. &ldquo;I practised for hours,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I was determined not to read and not to say &lsquo;er&rsquo; or &lsquo;um&rsquo;. I have remained true to that ever since.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0qd\"}}</p><p>After three days of talks, the meeting came to a close with a speech by Sir Solly Zuckerman, an anatomist who had studied monkeys in Africa, and gone on to become secretary of the Society and chief science adviser to the Ministry of Defence. Although Goodall had been well received, Zuckerman took the opportunity to fire a volley of pointed comments at the twentysomething newcomer.</p><p>&ldquo;There are those who are here and who prefer anecdote &ndash; and what I must confess I regard as sometimes unbounded speculation,&rdquo; he told his audience, as recounted in Dale Peterson&rsquo;s biography of Goodall, <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/books/Blum.t.html?pagewanted=all\">The Woman Who Redefined Man</a>. &ldquo;In scientific work it is far safer to base one&rsquo;s major conclusions and generalisations on a concordant and large body of data than on a few contradictory and isolated observations, the explanation of which sometimes leaves a little to be desired.&rdquo;</p><p>At the mention of Zuckerman, Goodall&rsquo;s features sharpen slightly, and the pace of her speech quickens. She dismisses his monkey work as &ldquo;rubbish&rdquo;. It is the only bad word she has to say about anyone, and even then she controls the emotion almost before it has appeared.</p><p>This was not Goodall&rsquo;s first run-in with Zuckerman. At the end of 1961, there had been a press conference at London Zoo to announce her preliminary findings &ndash; and she had hatched a plan to use this public platform to call for an improvement in the conditions of the captive chimps at the zoo. &ldquo;There was a bare cage with a cement floor,&rdquo; she explains. During the summer months, the chimps had no shade: &ldquo;It got boiling hot and there was only one platform, the other had broken, so the male got that and the female had to sit on the floor. It was horrible.&rdquo;</p><p>Before the meeting, over dinner with the diplomat Malcolm MacDonald (who had visited her briefly in Gombe and would become Governor-General of Kenya in 1963), Goodall shared her intention to champion the welfare of the captive chimps: &ldquo;I was really excited.&rdquo;</p><p>But MacDonald, with his experience as a politician, could see a flaw. Speaking out on behalf of the chimps to a packed auditorium would be a direct criticism of Zuckerman&rsquo;s leadership of the zoo. &ldquo;Do you think he&rsquo;s going to allow a little whipper-snapper who doesn&rsquo;t even have a degree to tell him he&rsquo;s in the wrong?&rdquo; Goodall recalls MacDonald telling her. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll make an enemy for life, and you don&rsquo;t want an enemy like that.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0r0\"}}</p><p>Instead, Goodall suggested several simple changes to the chimps&rsquo; enclosure that would improve their welfare, and MacDonald worked behind the scenes to see them implemented. &ldquo;What I learned then is: don&rsquo;t let people lose face, don&rsquo;t try to do something publicly until you&rsquo;ve tried every which way to do it quietly. I&rsquo;ve found that so helpful to me,&rdquo; she says, particularly in places like Africa and China.</p><p>Naturally, Zuckerman took the credit for the improvements to the chimps&rsquo; enclosure. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind two hoots as long as it gets done,&rdquo; Goodall says. <br /> <strong><br /> </strong>A capacity for seeing the bigger picture may go some way to explaining her success as an activist. She pinpoints her transformation to 1986, and a chimpanzee conference organised by the Chicago Academy of Sciences to coincide with the publication of The Chimpanzees of Gombe. By then, she&rsquo;d spent more than 25 years in the field, completed her PhD, established the Gombe Stream Research Center, got married, raised a son and made further groundbreaking observations on chimpanzee society &ndash; including insights into chimp communication, sex, mother&ndash;infant bonding, inter-community warfare and cannibalism. But at the age of 52, she walked away from the field and turned to a life on the road. &ldquo;How ridiculous, really, when you think about it,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;What did I think I could do, trotting around Africa with an exhibit of old pictures blown up, and bits of rock and stick?&rdquo;</p><p>Her initial focus &ndash; facilitated by the Jane Goodall Institute she&rsquo;d established almost a decade earlier to support her chimp research at Gombe &ndash; was to draw attention to the plight of chimpanzees more generally. In the wild, habitat destruction, the bushmeat trade and animal trafficking all posed significant threats to the species&rsquo; future &ndash; and they still do. &ldquo;It is horrendous.&rdquo;</p><p>Even now, China is asking African governments for chimpanzees and gorillas for entertainment, Goodall tells me. &ldquo;We feel our sanctuaries, which cost us so much money, aren&rsquo;t safe any more.&rdquo;</p><p>I find myself being sucked into a vortex of gloom, but Goodall is always ready to offer a reason for hope &ndash; a word that crops up time and again in the titles of her many books. One reason is what she calls &ldquo;the resilience of nature&rdquo;; by way of illustration, she tells me about land reforms in Tanzania in the 1970s that resulted in widespread deforestation around the Gombe Stream Chimpanzee Reserve.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0s2\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;When I looked down,&rdquo; she recalls of one visit, &ldquo;it was so totally shocking to see our little oasis of Gombe&hellip; It looked like a dust bowl: completely bare hills, overfarmed, more people living there than the land could support.&rdquo;</p><p>Today, however, as a result of the <a href=\"http://www.ehproject.org/phe/jgi-tanzania_final.html\">Lake Tanganyika Catchment, Reforestation and Education Project</a>, which her Institute began in 1994, the Gombe chimps now have &ldquo;three to four times more forest than they had ten years ago. It&rsquo;s regenerated so quickly. So we have 30-foot-high trees.&rdquo; I feel better already.</p><p>More than half a century since she first engineered improvements to the conditions of the chimpanzees at London Zoo, Goodall is still fighting hard on behalf of captive chimps too. In the 1980s, she raised ethical concerns about their use in xenotransplanation, which led the medical community to steer away from this practice. More recently, she has worked with Francis Collins, Director of the National Institutes of Health in the US, to phase out their use of captive chimpanzees in medical research; she is delighted the US Senate voted to increase the budget available for retirement of these chimps. &ldquo;We are beginning to win,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>I ask Goodall if she is in favour of a blanket ban on the use of chimpanzees in medical research. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t quite say that. But what I can say is that, ethically and morally, I feel it's wrong to use them, and it&rsquo;s absolutely wrong to put them in five-foot by five-foot cages.&rdquo;</p><p>Goodall puts chimps at the forefront of the wider debate about the use of experimental animals. &ldquo;At one time, the scientists said we&rsquo;ll always need animals for this &ndash; and now we don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;If science really puts its mind to getting alternatives&hellip; once they do, they&rsquo;re cheaper and usually safer.&rdquo;</p><p>With our time almost up, I realise I haven&rsquo;t asked after Mr H, the toy monkey who famously travels with her from one venue to the next. Somehow Goodall the activist doesn&rsquo;t seem complete without him, and I wonder if he might join us.</p><p>Mr H stands for Mr Gary Haun, a US marine who lost his eyesight in a helicopter crash at the age of 21, then went on to became a professional magician, climb Mount Kilimanjaro, scuba, sky-dive, and much else besides. &ldquo;He thought he was giving me a stuffed chimp for my birthday,&rdquo; Goodall recalls &ndash; but the soft toy has a tail, so is clearly a monkey. &ldquo;Gary,&rdquo; she told him, as she guided his hand towards the evidence of his mistake, &ldquo;I know you can&rsquo;t see it&hellip; but you have no excuse.&rdquo;</p><p>For the last 20 years, Goodall has kept Mr H close as a reminder of another of her reasons for hope: &ldquo;The indomitable human spirit&hellip; He&rsquo;s been to at least 60 countries with me, he&rsquo;s been touched by at least four million people. I say that when you touch him, the inspiration rubs off.&rdquo;</p><p>Goodall invites me to touch Mr H &ndash; but instead of inspiration, I have a sudden, parental panic that he might one day go missing. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve nearly lost him several times but that&rsquo;s the original,&rdquo; she says, stroking him gently. Once, she left him on the top of a telephone kiosk in an airport and had boarded her plane before she realised. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to get off the plane,&rdquo; she explained to the attendant, adding: &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to bolt me in to keep me because I&rsquo;ve left my most precious object outside.&rdquo;</p><p>Still clutching Mr H, Goodall reaches into her bag and another soft toy peeps out. &ldquo;This is Cow&rdquo; &ndash; a gift handed to her during a recent visit to the dairyland state of Wisconsin. &ldquo;I was going to give Cow to the next deserving child,&rdquo; she explains, but instead she has turned her into &ldquo;a spokesperson&rdquo; for abused farm animals. She looks at the toy and then talks about it as if she&rsquo;s giving it praise. &ldquo;Cow has worked really hard &ndash; she has created I don&rsquo;t know how many vegetarians, even in places like Argentina where they live on meat.&rdquo;</p><p>I am reminded of something I&rsquo;ve read: how Goodall, as a child, loved to arrange tea parties for her soft toys. I wonder if there are others who would like to join us &ndash; but it turns out that Jubilee, her childhood chimpanzee, is in Germany, being fitted for a jumpsuit to hold his failing stitching in place.</p><p>Goodall herself is flying to Germany in a few hours. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to D&uuml;sseldorf, then Vienna, then back to Munich&hellip; It still amazes me.

Because it&rsquo;s making a difference.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wk0x7\"}}</p><p>When not on the move, she concentrates on her writing. In her latest book, Seeds of Hope, she and journalist Gail Hudson champion plants. But the first edition, published last year, was troubled by allegations of plagiarism, with the Washington Post identifying &ldquo;at least a dozen passages borrowed without attribution, or footnotes, from a variety of websites&rdquo;.</p><p>Goodall accounts for these lapses by citing her hectic work schedule and her chaotic method of note-taking: &ldquo;I am not methodical enough, I guess,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;In some cases, you look at my notebooks, there&rsquo;s no way you can tell whether this is from talking to somebody or whether it was something I read on the internet.&rdquo;</p><p>I ask if there was any naivety on her part. &ldquo;Yes, there must be&hellip; I have learned. In the future, I shall be more organised even if I don&rsquo;t have time,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I shall certainly make sure I know who said something or what I read or where I read it.&rdquo; Goodall, though, is adamant that she did not intentionally try to pass off anyone else&rsquo;s words as her own. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think anybody who knows me would accuse me of deliberate plagiarism.&rdquo;</p><p>In a revised edition of Seeds of Hope, to be published this month, Goodall and Hudson have made minor changes to the text to address their critics and added a lengthy notes section. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think a book has ever been more researched than this one. The notes at the end are about as long as the book.&rdquo;</p><p>I ask if she&rsquo;s concerned that attention will focus on what she&rsquo;s changed, rather than on the subject matter. &ldquo;Looking back, it has been a godsend,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I am really happy for the sake of the plants that we&rsquo;ve got it right now. I feel this is a book we can really be proud of now.&rdquo;</p><p>And then she adds, &ldquo;Honestly, Henry, who is going to deliberately go out to give me a bad time?&rdquo;</p><p>Before I go, Goodall wants to show me some drawings she made as a child. They are reproduced in <a href=\"http://childrensbooks.about.com/od/awardwinners/ss/Best-Illustrated-Childrens-Books-of-the-Year-2011_8.htm\">Me&hellip; Jane</a>, a children&rsquo;s book by Patrick McDonnell. She finds a copy amid piles of books by or about her, and flips to the relevant page. There, across a double spread, are several meticulous sketches of animals. The wing of a pterodactyl above the wing of an eagle; profiles of a cat, horse, crocodile, dog, chimpanzee and human &ndash; all to scale with their brains neatly coloured in pink pencil. &ldquo;They are not very good,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>I have spent the last two hours in the polite, inspiring company of a woman precisely twice my age. But as she shows me her drawings, I get the feeling I am talking to the 12-year-old Goodall. Finally, when I hold out my hand for her to shake, she spurns it and offers me something far more rewarding: a chimpanzee embrace. Her delicate arms envelop me, slowly, widely, deliberately. There is something categorically different about this hug; something that will stay with me for ever.</p><p>&ldquo;Chimpanzees don&rsquo;t say goodbye,&rdquo; she says. I walk to the door, trying to fathom what to make of this. I turn and call out another farewell, but Goodall doesn&rsquo;t reply. She has turned away from me and doesn&rsquo;t look back.</p><p><em>This article was originally commissioned by <a href=\"http://www.mosaicscience.com/\">Mosaic</a>, and reproduced under a Creative Commons licence.

She felt fine all day, but in the afternoon she developed extreme crushing pain in her chest, radiating through her left arm. It's a classic sign of a heart attack, but the puzzling thing was that she didn't suffer from coronary heart disesase. There was no life-threatening clot in the arteries surrounding the heart.</p><p>It looked, from the outside, like a heart attack, but it wasn't. Describing the <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM198605083141908\">unusual case in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>, Thomas Ryan, and John Fallon suggest the apparent damage to the heart muscle was emotional rather than physiological. Earlier that day, she had been informed that her 17-year-old son had committed suicide.</p><p>Could the woman have suffered from a broken heart? The answer, it turned out, was already hiding in plain sight. The Massachusetts case was surprising to doctors &ndash; but it wasn&rsquo;t news to everybody.</p><p>For many years, doctors scorned the idea of a relationship between psychology and physiology. In their book <a href=\"http://zoobiquity.com/\">Zoobiquity</a>, Kathryn Bowers and Barbara Natterson-Horowitz described this attitude: \"Among many physicians, the idea that emotions could cause actual physical events within the architecture of the heart was viewed with nearly the same sideways glance as an interest in healing crystals or homeopathy. Real cardiologists concentrated on real problems you could see: arterial plaque, embolising blood clots, and rupturing aortas. Sensitivity was for psychiatrists.\"</p><p>Despite this, the evidence that extreme emotions can impact the heart goes back decades &ndash; only not among humans. It was wildlife biologists and veterinarians who first noticed that extreme emotions can wreak havoc on body physiology. By the mid-20th Century, they noticed that a curious thing happens when an animal experiences a sudden jolt of life-or-death fear. When it's caught by an advancing predator, adrenaline fills the bloodstream to such an extent that the blood almost becomes like a poison, damaging the animal's muscles, including the heart. It&rsquo;s called &ldquo;capture myopathy&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wj7f0\"}}</p><p>By 1974, the effect was so well known to veterinarians that <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v247/n5442/abs/247577a0.html\">a letter in Nature proposing a possible way to avoid it</a> didn't even bother explaining what it was in the first place. By then, researchers had realised that capturing animals for scientific or conservation purposes &ndash; such as for captive breeding, for mark-and-release studies, or for relocation &ndash; was often, ironically, fatal.</p><p>Indeed, by the time that physicians were puzzling over that strange, apparently emotion-driven heart-attack in Massachusetts, veterinarians had already recognised stress-related cardiomyopathy in a tremendous variety of non-human species: <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/924867\">elk</a>, <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/924865\">pronghorn sheep</a>, <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/924866\">moose</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/3782553\">deer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jwildlifedis.org/doi/abs/10.7589/0090-3558-23.3.454\">scimitar-horned oryx, antelope, muntjac, wisent, gazelle</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0006320783900265\">dugongs</a>, and <a href=\"http://jwildlifedis.org/doi/abs/10.7589/0090-3558-23.3.447\">wild turkeys</a>.

Animals who are most prone to capture myopathy are small mammals, ungulates, birds, and anxious primates.</p><p>From around the mid-1990s, more case studies in humans, too, began to hint at physiological problems due to extreme psychological stress. In 1995, researchers Jeremy Kark, Silvie Goldman, and Leon Epstein found that Israelis were more likely to die as a result of heart-related problems on 18 January 1991 than on any day in the preceding and subsequent two months, as well as for the same period of time the previous year. That's because that's when the Persian Gulf War began, resulting in 18 missiles directed at Israel from Iraq. To be clear, the increase in mortality measured by this study was not due to injuries directly caused by the missile attacks; they were cardiovascular-related deaths that mostly occurred outside of hospital care.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wj8sm\"}}</p><p>\"The perception of an imminent, life-threatening situation was widespread,\" the researchers wrote in the <a href=\"http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=387994\">Journal of the American Medical Association</a>. \"To prepare for chemical attack, gas masks and automatic syringes containing atropine were distributed to the entire population. Every household prepared a sealed room. Civil defence instructions were issued in the media.\" The entire country was heavy with anxiety to begin with, and the life-or-death fear associated with missile strikes was too much for some to bear.</p><p>The following year, a different group of researchers took a look at sudden cardiac-related deaths in Los Angeles on 17 January 1994. That day was when a magnitude 6.8 earthquake &ndash; \"one of the strongest earthquakes ever recorded in a major city in North America,\" the researchers noted &ndash; struck the region at 4:31am. In the <a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199602153340701\">New England Journal of Medicine</a>, they reported a massive spike in cardiovascular-related deaths due to the stress of the early-morning jolt. As in the case of the Israeli missile attacks, that doesn't include traumatic injuries directly caused by the earthquake. These deaths are instead attributable to the extreme stress of being shaken awake by a violent earthquake. It should be noted, however, that many of those who died were not entirely healthy to begin with.</p><p>In the 1990s Japanese researchers coined the term &ldquo;takotsubo cardiomyopathy&rdquo; to describe a stress-induced apparent heart attack. It was so-named because the ballooning of the left ventricle characteristic of this sort of cardiomyopathy is reminiscent to a type of fishing pot, called takotsubo, which are used to trap octopuses.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01wj8x4\"}}</p><p>But it wasn't until 2005 that enough studies had been described in the medical literature that human medicine began to fully take note. That year the concept of <a href=\"http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.med.041908.191750\">stress cardiomyopathy</a> was firmly established within the medical literature, though many physicians still refer to is as takotsubo, or occasionally as \"broken heart syndrome.\"</p><p>So while it isn&rsquo;t necessarily sadness or rejection that can hurt us physiologically, there is now little doubt that the mind and our emotions can have a direct, measurable effect on our physical bodies, and when things take a turn for the worse, it can lead to catastrophe.</p><p>After consulting with veterinarians at the Los Angeles Zoo, it was Natterson-Horowitz, a UCLA cardiology professor, who put the heart-related aspects of capture myopathy with takotsubo cardiomyopathy side by side. In Zoobiquity, she and Bowers, a journalist, ask whether the two syndromes are really one and the same, afflicting humans and animals alike.</p><p>It&rsquo;s just a shame that it took so long for doctors to accept what wildlife biologists and veterinarians had known for decades. If this episode teaches us anything, it&rsquo;s that the traits we share with animals run far deeper than first appears. As this column has explored, the commonalities are myriad, whether it&rsquo;s the ability to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20121030-lords-of-the-dance\">dance</a>, to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20121114-election-day-animal-style/\">rule by democracy</a>, or to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131104-natures-grossest-perfume\">lure the opposite sex with perfume</a>. They&rsquo;re written into the very fabric of our biology. Our species occupies but one tiny branch on the enormous tree of life; it would be a shame if our hubris prevented us from applying knowledge derived from decades of research on every other species on the planet to our own.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-31T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Can you die of a broken heart?","HeadlineShort":"Can you die of a broken heart?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Extreme emotion can be a killer, says Jason G Goldman.

Probably not, but you will have a pretty good idea that I have my own thoughts, perceptions and intentions. This &ldquo;theory of mind&rdquo; is something that we take for granted, yet the ability to step into somebody else&rsquo;s shoes is what has helped to make us such a success as a social species. Is it a trait only humans have? <br /> <strong><br /> </strong>Over the next few columns in <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/uniquely-human\">the Uniquely Human series</a>, I will be exploring the mind-reading abilities of humans and animals in all forms. We start with one of the most basic aspects of theory of mind: the ability to deceive somebody. Successful deception, after all, requires you to imagine what somebody else would think. The question is, are we the only species capable of such trickery? <br /> <strong><br /> </strong>To find out, we first have to look to experiments conducted more than 30 years ago. In 1978, psychologists David Premack and Guy Woodruff wondered if <a href=\"http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7131588\">chimpanzees have theory of mind</a>. At the time, researchers thought that deception might be a good way to get at the question, so Premack and Woodruff tried to see if chimpanzees could be taught to deceive fellow chimpanzees. If a snack was hidden in one box, could they learn to trick a competitor into searching in the second box by pointing at it? The researchers only managed to teach two of four chimpanzees to do this, and it took them a whopping five months to get it right. It wasn't the most convincing evidence. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> Open and shut case? Not so fast. Chimpanzees have trouble comprehending the pointing gesture in the first place. Pointing with their hands and fingers is not part of their own behavioral repertoire. It simply wasn't a fair test.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Then, in 1987, science writer Virginia Morell witnessed <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/02/animal_wise_how_virginia_morell_began_to_report_on_intelligence_and_emotions.html\">a now-classic example of apparent chimpanzee deception</a> while visiting Jane Goodall at Gombe National Park in Tanzania. The two were hiding in a feeding station, a spot where Goodall and her team sometimes handed bananas out to passing chimps. A high-ranking male called Beethoven ambled by, along with Dilly, an orphan who Beethoven had adopted. Beethoven immediately let out a food call, standard behavior for a chimpanzee. After promptly devouring the whole bunch &ndash; chimpanzees tend not to share food, even with their infants &ndash; Beethoven settled down for an afternoon nap, leaving a hungry Dilly to groom him. Goodall then made eye contact with Dilly and held up a single banana. \"It was as if a signal passed between her and Dilly,\" Morell <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2013/02/animal_wise_how_virginia_morell_began_to_report_on_intelligence_and_emotions.html\">recounted on the website Slate this year</a>. \"Dilly did not utter a food cry, as chimpanzees normally do, but simply watched as Goodall placed the banana outside on the ground. Then Dilly quietly made her way to the fruit, downed it in three bites, and just as quietly returned to the snoring Beethoven.\"<br /> &nbsp;<br /> Not only did Dilly appear to infer Goodall's intention in leaving the banana for her, but she also understood that Beethoven would gobble up the banana himself if given half a chance. By stifling her food call, she could keep Beethoven in the dark, none the wiser about her illicit snacking.</p><p><strong>Trick of the mind</strong></p><p>Still, at the time it was verboten for researchers to infer emotion, intention, or motivation within an animal. Goodall would describe the behavior \"as if\" it was deceptive. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> And it certainly was a stretch to say that this meant chimpanzees had theory of mind. Scientists needed empirical evidence derived from controlled experiments before they could make any firm conclusions. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> One way that researchers tried &ndash; experimentally &ndash; to get at the question of chimpanzee theory of mind in the subsequent years was &ldquo;gaze-following&rdquo;. Could a chimpanzee tell what you're looking at by following your gaze? In 1996, psychologists <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1996-06439-002\">Daniel Povinelli and Timothy Eddy gave some juvenile chimps a test</a>: the apes were given a choice to ask for food either from a human who could see them clearly, or from to a human whose eyes were hidden, such as by wearing a bucket on his head. In most cases, they begged indiscriminately. It seemed that the young chimps didn't care whether a human was actually able to see them while begging for food in all but the most obvious cases. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> If chimps couldn't even understand what others could and couldn&rsquo;t see, then it seems unlikely that they could deceive, let alone attribute more sophisticated goals and intentions to others. How could the story of Dilly and Beethoven be explained? Like the experiments of the 1970s, the reason could be that Povinelli and Eddy had thrust their chimpanzees into a strange situation. The experiments had arbitrary conditions that were perhaps not obvious to the chimps, such as the rule that they were only allowed to make one choice per trial. From the chimp's perspective, it could actually be quite reasonable to beg from everyone until someone hands over a tasty treat.</p><p>The flaws of such experiments led evolutionary anthropologist Brian Hare to develop a more <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347299913775\">naturalistic, species-appropriate test for chimpanzees</a>. That meant he had to think like a chimpanzee. What he devised was a clever situation in which a subordinate chimp could compete for food with a more dominant chimp. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> In his experiments, Hare set up <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347200915185\">enclosures containing two chimps, one at either end</a>. He placed food in the centre. Thanks to well placed barriers, sometimes both chimps could see the food; sometimes only one. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> In one instance, Hare allowed a dominant and a subordinate chimp to watch as he put food in the middle. However, the food was obscured from the dominant one once it was placed down. <br /> &nbsp;<br /> As is typical for chimpanzees in this sort of scenario, the subordinate all but ignored the food, leaving it for the dominant. Subordinate chimps know better than to take food from dominant group members, just as Dilly knew not to let Beethoven catch her eating that banana. Even though the dominant couldn&rsquo;t see the food, it knew where it was.</p><p>Then Hare added a twist: when the dominant chimp was replaced with a second dominant who hadn't seen the food &ndash; all she could see was opaque barriers &ndash; the subordinate had no problem gobbling it down. The conclusion? Chimpanzees don't just know what others see; they also know what others know.</p><p><strong>Animal trickery</strong><br /> &nbsp;<br /> The so-called \"Hare task\" has since been adapted and modified for a wide range of animals. A clever experiment in which <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347206000662\">rhesus monkeys could steal food</a> either from a silent box or from a box outfitted with bells showed that they anticipated what others would and would not hear. Another set of studies demonstrated that <a href=\"http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/272/1573/1641.short\">ravens, too, know what others do and do not see</a>. The food-caching corvids were more likely to hide their caches in a spot hidden from the view of others. If, while caching, they discovered a potential raider watching them, the ravens usually <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347202930563\">picked up and tried to hide their cache</a> elsewhere. Together, these experiments demonstrate both the ravens' gaze-following abilities and their tactical deception skills.</p><p>How about our pets? Well, researchers know <a href=\"http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591%2810%2900177-2/abstract\">dogs can be sneaky</a>. In one experiment, dogs were instructed not to take food from boxes, a few of which were rigged with noisy bells. Yet when a researcher wasn&rsquo;t looking, the dogs would steal a meal, and would deliberately avoid the boxes with bells to avoid detection.</p><p>The evidence gathered so far suggests that many clever animals are capable of deception, and some can make basic predictions about the \"knowledge states\" of others. They can predict what others can see, and sometimes what others can hear, and they can use that information for their own benefit. They know who is knowledgeable and who is naive. Perhaps we should give their mind-reading talents more credit.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook page</em></a><em> or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Our animal behaviour uncovered.

Our love for our children generally outweighs our aversion to their bodily waste, but nobody actually enjoys changing a dirty nappy. At baby showers in the US, a game involving eating chocolate from clean, unused nappies still thoroughly grosses participants out. Many species share our aversion to faeces, however others actively seek it out &ndash; a finding that highlights the evolutionary logic beneath our apparently visceral reactions to waste.</p><p>Disgust, <a href=\"http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1227/1227-h/1227-h.htm\">according to Charles Darwin</a>, is one of the six most basic, universal emotions. The facial expression of it, which by some measures is recognisable across cultures, involves the wrinkling of the nose combined with a frown. This outward expression is accompanied by inner physiological changes like lowered blood pressure, reduced skin conductance and nausea.</p><p>Before the advent of indoor plumbing, we did our business in holes, structures and facilities entirely separate from our living spaces to avoid the stuff. Our aversion to waste even extends to the waste of other species: dog owners who fail to clean up after their dogs can face hefty fines.</p><p>Ours is not the only species that goes out of its way to avoid exposure to disgusting things like excrement, and for good reason. Psychologist Paul Rozin, of the University of Pennsylvania, argues that <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&amp;UID=2008-07784-047\">our disgust response</a> reduces the likelihood of ingesting disease-causing microorganisms in decayed meat, faeces, vomit, or blood. It may even help keep us away from others who may be infected or diseased. In his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/How-Mind-Works-Steven-Pinker/dp/0393318486\">How the Mind Works</a>, US psychologist Steven Pinker writes that disgust may reflect an intuitive understanding of microbiology. \"Since germs are transmissible by contact, it is not surprising that something that touches a yucky substance is itself forever yucky,\" he says.</p><p>It's not just us. Some other species also quite sensibly prefer foraging for food far from where they defecate. Cows, for example, do not just graze randomly. By <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v175/n4468/abs/1751088a0.html\">avoiding areas contaminated with faeces</a>, they gobble up far fewer parasitic lungworm larvae. The same is true for sheep. Researchers at the University of Aberdeen, UK showed in experiments how sheep <a href=\"http://www.appliedanimalbehaviour.com/article/S0168-1591(00)00116-7/abstract\">overwhelmingly preferred plots uncontaminated with faeces</a> to those containing it. They were unable to distinguish between faeces infected with parasites and uninfected faeces, and so operated according to an \"avoid all the poo\" rule. Horses leave the parts of their fields where they eliminate ungrazed as well. Wild reindeer also selectively forage in uncontaminated areas, as do many primates.</p><p>But not all species explicitly avoid contact with yuck-inducing substances. In fact, some actually seem to seek out faeces. Patrick Walsh and Amy Pederson from the University of Edinburgh, UK, together with Erin McCreless from the University of California, Santa Cruz, noticed that the related wild white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) re-inhabit the burrows of previous occupiers that contain both food and faeces.</p><p><strong>Turd fans</strong></p><p>The researchers conducted <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347213002959\">three different experiments</a> to see whether the mice truly prefer being near the smelly stuff. Their first finding was that, like sheep, they could not distinguish between the droppings of parasitised and healthy mice. But the second finding was a complete surprise: the mice were more likely to choose to spend their time in an enclosure containing faeces than in a clean one. When given a choice, they preferred cotton previously used by other mice to unused cotton for nest-building. Perhaps most surprising the mice even preferred parasitised cotton balls to clean ones.</p><p>These preferences also applied to their foraging behaviour. The mice were no less likely to eat seeds that were found near faecal material &ndash; whether infected or not &ndash; than to eat seeds that were clean.</p><p>In a way, the mice were the opposite of the sheep. Neither animal could distinguish parasitised from healthy droppings, yet sheep responded by playing it safe, while the mice took a gamble. The crucial question is why? At first glance, their actions might seem like a bad idea, given the high costs of becoming infected.</p><p>What is really interesting is that domesticated rodents, such as mice and rats bred for laboratory use or for the pet trade, do avoid faeces. As wild reindeer and primates also avoid faeces, domestication isn&rsquo;t the key, so what is it?</p><p>Walsh and colleagues believe that for their wild mice, the presence of faeces from other mice at a potential nesting location or near food suggests safety from predators. When the wrong move could land you between the teeth of a bigger animal, perhaps the risk of infection from faecal matter is the lesser of two concerns.</p><p>Laboratory animals, pets, and livestock are generally at a much lower risk from predators than their wild counterparts, so they can be more selective in their foraging and nesting behaviours. Every animal, the researchers argue, must calculate the trade-off between dodging parasites and surviving another day.</p><p>When you look at it this way, our faecal avoidance is something of a luxury. Perhaps our species' lack of natural predators means we are lucky to be able to afford to be disgusted by faeces and other disgusting things. Knowing this may give you a better understanding of your reaction next time you encounter a dirty nappy or some dog waste on the sole of your shoe. It probably won't make them smell of roses though.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook page</em></a><em> or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-11-11T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do humans hate poo so much?","HeadlineShort":"Hate poo?

One such book of rules, called Manners, Culture, and Dress of the Best American Society, suggested women should emulate the moss-rose to become \"beautiful in spirit and in intellect, when they are but half-unfolded.\" Another gave instruction in the use of floral perfumes, proposing \"a faint suggestion of the violet or the wild olive is most delicate and lady-like.\" Men, on the other hand, have traditionally used fragrances based on musks and spices.</p><p>Of course humans have been masking their true odours for thousands, not just hundreds, of years. Archaeological discoveries suggest perfumes were being created from extracts of myrtle, cypress, and other plants in Mesopotamian palaces millenia ago.</p><p>In human life, smells play a variety of fundamental roles. From birth, infants can <a href=\"http://chemse.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/1/3.short\">distinguish</a> the scent of their mother's breasts. Since failure to feed can ultimately result in dehydration or death, some researchers think that the ability to identify those odours may itself be critical in promoting feeding-related behaviours. And as adults, certain body odours can determine a person&rsquo;s attractiveness. Smells also have a direct influence on our emotions. Stephen Warrenburg, a researcher at <a href=\"http://www.iff.com/company/company-overview.aspx\">International Flavors and Fragrances</a>, a New York-based company, has found test subjects <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/chemse/bjh208\">associate odours with particular feelings</a>. For example, both clementine and vanilla are reported as pleasing, but while clementine is thought of as stimulating, vanilla apparently makes people feel more relaxed.</p><p>Smell is important to various other animals too. What is less well known is that the intentional creation of aromas is not a uniquely human trait. There is at least one other animal that practices the ancient art of perfume mixing, and perhaps the most disgusting is the male greater sac-winged bat, Saccopteryx bilineata.</p><p>Colonies of up to 60 of these bats are found from northern Argentina to southern Mexico. These are divided into a number of harems, each consisting of one male and multiple females, and controlling a territory of between one and two square metres. Males without partners roost on the outskirts of the harems, waiting to surreptitiously mate with females.</p><p><strong>'Perfume containers'</strong></p><p>Males with harems mark the boundaries of their territories with excretions from small, furless, nipple-like projections found under their chins called gular glands. But to court a female, they require a mixture of secretions from these glands, their genitals and urine. That's where their wing sacs come in.</p><p>The sacs, found on the inside of the wing, are 8-10mm in length, which is large given the animal&rsquo;s size. Despite the presence of what researchers call \"odiferous content\" &ndash; smelly stuff, basically &ndash; within the wing sac, there isn't a scent gland inside. Instead of excreting directly into the sac, males transfer fluids from other parts of their body into them. \"Thus wing sacs could also be called holding sacs or perfume containers,\" says <a href=\"http://www.batlab.de/\">Christian Voigt</a>, of the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research in Berlin.</p><p>Each afternoon, male greater sac-winged bats in a colony <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003347201919840\">make a new batch</a> of perfume. They begin by bending forward repeatedly, using their mouths to suck up a bit of urine, and then transferring it by licking the interior of their wing-sacs. They then bend forward as before, but this time they press their gular glands against their penises to combine excretions from both, before transferring the mixture to their wing sacs. This continues until both sacs have a sufficient amount of bat perfume. The process lasts 30 to 60 minutes. All 51 species in the family Emballonuridae have wing sacs, but S. bilineata is the only species known to engage in this complex form of perfumery.</p><p>At dawn and dusk, either at the start or the end of the nightly feeding, a male approaches a roosting female. While hovering and singing a courtship song, he opens his sacs and flaps his wings horizontally to blow the air scented with his perfume over her.</p><p>The males perform their excretory alchemy in both the mating and non-mating seasons. While critical for courtship, Voigt and other bat scientists think that the perfume must therefore play other social roles, perhaps underlying individual recognition or reinforcing a male's position within the dominance hierarchy.</p><p>Indeed, the fact that each male spends up to an hour each day cleaning and refilling his wing sacs strongly suggests that perfume &ndash; and smells, more generally &ndash; plays a fundamental role in the social communication of this species. It also means that bat noses, as with human noses, are critical to survival.</p><p>Perfume companies, with total <a href=\"http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/global-fragrances-industry-worth-38-000000901.html\">global revenues of around $31.6bn last year</a>, are of course always on the look-out for novel fragrance combinations. For readers from the industry wondering whether there might be potential in &ldquo;eau de bat&rdquo;, Voigt describes its smell as \"sweetish, with a touch of bitter almond.\"</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook page</em></a><em> or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-11-04T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The bats that mix nature’s grossest perfume","HeadlineShort":"Nature’s grossest perfume","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Humans are not the only species that makes perfumes, but you might think twice before sniffing the stinky cocktail mixed by this bat.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Humans are not the only species that makes perfumes, but you might think twice before sniffing the stinky cocktail mixed by this bat.","SummaryShort":"The stinky cocktail mixed by bats","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"bd92da35-5971-4b22-af43-a09d72f594a3","Id":"wwfuture/story/20131104-natures-grossest-perfume","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20131104-natures-grossest-perfume"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20131104-natures-grossest-perfume","_id":"55dc6371e2b83951eb9970db"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":[],"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"gallery","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>When you run your hands through your lover&rsquo;s hair, you&rsquo;re probably not thinking about your place in the social hierarchy. Give your team-mate or colleague a pat on the back after a setback, and the chances are you&rsquo;re not consciously seeking to change the mix of signalling chemicals in their brain. It may not seem like it, but these socially important rituals and others like them predate the time our species first walked the African savannah.</p><p>Human behaviours that involve physical social contact have a lot more in common with social grooming activities we typically associate with other species than we might initially think. When rhesus monkeys or chimpanzees pick through their friends' fur, they're not just helping them remove dirt and parasites from hard to reach spots. There is undoubtedly a hygienic benefit, but this behaviour, which animal behaviour researchers call &ldquo;allogrooming&rdquo;, has far greater significance. The gelada baboon, for example, spends 17% of its waking hours doing this when just 1% would be sufficient to achieve good hygiene, according to <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19771420\">one estimate</a>. Allogrooming is the currency of what primatologist <a href=\"http://www.psychology.emory.edu/nab/dewaal/\">Frans de Waal</a> calls the \"marketplace of services\" in chimpanzee life: it defines the social hierarchy, which in turn dictates access to food, sex, and social support.</p><p>For example, one chimpanzee is <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513897000858\">more likely to share food</a> with another that has previously groomed it. Grooming also serves to ease tensions in a chimp troop following an aggressive situation. One of the <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/289/5479/586.short\">most complex forms of reconciliation</a> among chimpanzees occurs when two rival males reach a point of stalemate, neither backing down nor escalating the aggressive interaction. Sometimes, a female breaks the deadlock and eases the tension by grooming first one male, and then the other, until the two become relaxed enough to end what amounted to an angry staring contest.</p><p>According to anthropologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Dunbar\">Robin Dunbar</a>, this works because <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/gpr/8/2/100/\">grooming stimulates the release of endorphins</a> &ndash; opiates produced by the brain that trigger feelings of relaxation by lowering the heart rate, reducing overt nervous behaviours like scratching, and even bringing on sleep. Female chimps that use grooming as a peacekeeping strategy may also experience their own rush of endorphins and enjoy many of the same benefits.</p><p>Humans, lacking the fur of our more hirsute evolutionary cousins, had to find a replacement for allogrooming. Like grooming, gossip establishes and maintains our place in the social hierarchy. Also like grooming, the social information that makes up gossip is itself a form of currency in human culture. Or, at least, that's the theory put forward by Dunbar. He argued, in his book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Grooming-Gossip-Evolution-Language-Dunbar/dp/0674363361\">Grooming, Gossip and the Evolution of Language</a>, that the faculty of language allowed our species to substitute gossip for grooming.</p><p><strong>Pleasure principle</strong></p><p>But grooming, and related forms of social physical contact, hasn't gone away entirely. While we humans don't make a habit of picking through our friends' hair for parasites &ndash; nurses searching for lice on the first day of summer camp notwithstanding &ndash; the truth is that gossip hasn't completely replaced our need for physical touch. Indeed, words don't always make adequate tools for communicating our feelings. Far more can be said by a heartfelt hug or squeeze on the shoulder after a friend suffers the loss of a relative than through words.</p><p>In the same way, one's love and desire for a partner can be conveyed with a seductive stroke far more effectively than even the words \"I want you\" ever could. Indeed, Dunbar writes, \"the physical stimulation of touch tells us more about the inner feelings of the 'groomer', and in a more direct way\" than words are able. And those forms of touch stimulate within us the same endorphin release that chimpanzees enjoy during social grooming.&nbsp;</p><p>Some scientists have even gone as far as calling the skin a \"social organ\". This makes good intuitive sense: we both crave touch and are repulsed by it when it is unwanted, uninvited, or inappropriate. Even simple, brief touches on a hand or arm can have tremendous effects. India Morrison and colleagues at Goteborg University, in Sweden, have presented <a href=\"http://www.his.se/PageFiles/166498/India_Morrison_3.pdf\">a laundry list of such findings</a>. Hand-on-hand touches by librarians and salespersons have, for example, been found to lead to more favourable impressions of libraries and shops. People perceive others as more attractive following even a simple, non-sexual touch, and as a result are more likely to act altruistically by returning change left in a pay phone, giving bigger tips in restaurants, or giving away a cigarette to a stranger.</p><p>And yet these effects might be thought of as simple parlour tricks compared to the power that touch has between lovers, or between parents and their children.&nbsp;</p><p>In one study, US psychologists investigated social grooming in humans by asking participants to indicate their closest emotional relationship and report behaviours such as running their fingers through the person&rsquo;s hair, wiping away their tears, scratching their back and non-sexual massage. They found levels of relationship satisfaction and trust were both <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-007-9009-3\">positively correlated with self-reported grooming frequency</a> among romantic partners. And one finding hinted at a causal relationship: people who were more anxious about their relationships \"groomed\" their partners more often than those who felt more secure with their partners, suggesting that grooming may serve to reduce relationship-related anxiety and to promote the development of romantic bonds. The pattern was true both for men and women.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Survival instinct</strong></p><p>Babies also crave touch. It has long been known among animal behaviour researchers that physical contact is critical for proper social and emotional development. When developmental psychologist Harry Harlow deprived infant rhesus monkeys of access to a monkey mother in his 1950s experiments at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, they became withdrawn, depressed, and anxious. They refused food, and entered into what he called a \"state of emotional shock.\" When allowed access to a surrogate mother, the infant monkeys overwhelmingly chose the tactile sensations provided by a doll covered by terry cloth over a wire doll that provided food and water. The young monkeys preferred the comfort of even an inanimate mother's touch to physical sustenance.&nbsp;</p><p>More <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0306452204007225\">recent research</a> with rats replicates Harlow's early findings. Canadian researchers found that when infant rats were licked and groomed more by their mothers, they grew up to be relatively well adjusted. But their counterparts who were deprived of grooming often grew up, like Harlow's monkeys, to be anxious and fearful. Touch-deprived rats also had weakened immune systems. It appears as if touch helps to maintain not only social and emotional health, but also physical health.</p><p>According to the World Health Organization, more than 20 million infants each year are born pre-term, which means that they weigh less than 5lb 8oz (2.5kg) upon birth. These babies have increased risk of death in the first few weeks of life. Caring for low-birth-weight infants in hospitals is expensive and requires highly skilled personnel, however research suggests a therapy called <a href=\"http://www.who.int/elena/titles/kangaroo_care_infants/en/\">kangaroo care</a> is both cheaper and just as effective. Originally developed in Bogota, Colombia, as a way of keeping preterm infants warm in overcrowded nurseries, the practice is deceptively simple. The mother or father simply has to repeatedly place their baby against their bare chest, ideally for prolonged periods.</p><p>A meta-analysis of three randomised control trials (the gold standard in biomedical research), conducted in Colombia, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Indonesia and Mexico <a href=\"http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/39/suppl_1/i144.full\">found that</a> babies born weighing 4lb 6oz (2kg) or less given kangaroo care in the first week of life were 51% less likely to die in the first four weeks after birth, compared with infants who received standard care.</p><p>Other <a href=\"http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/1919818/reload=0;jsessionid=SBmpjQRi15J5Vx23xLG2.18\">research</a> has found that kangaroo care helps to stabilise preterm infants' vital signs, maintains adequate oxygen levels in the blood, and helps them to sleep better. It also reduces crying, increases weight gain, and allows preterm infants to spend fewer days in incubators, ultimately allowing them to be discharged from neonatal intensive care units sooner than those who are treated with conventional care.</p><p>All primates, from monkey to man, rely on social touch. Among non-human primates, grooming is a tool used to garner favours, earn social standing, and increase access to resources. Gossip may have replaced parasite removal as a mechanism for defining and enhancing one's place in human society, but the desire to be touched is carved so deeply within our primate heritage that it remained even as we shed our fur. For an infant born prematurely, social touch can literally mean the difference between life and death. For the rest of us, being touched simply reminds us that we are loved.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story, or anything else on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook page</em></a><em> or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-10-14T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why humans and animals rely on social touch","HeadlineShort":"The touching moments we all need","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"From monkeys to humans, grooming is an important way to win favours and earn social standing.

Relationships can be fraught with the potential for miscommunication or misunderstanding at the best of times, so imagine how troublesome it is to admit, out loud, to your partner, that you've got a sexual interest or fantasy that sits far outside the cultural norms.</p><p>But here&rsquo;s a secret. For just about any fantasy between consenting adults that might be thought of as beyond conventional sexual practices or decency as dictated by society, you can bet that there's a non-human species for whom that particular behaviour is commonplace. Sure, there are plenty of examples of creative role-playing, food in the bedroom, or unusual places to do the deed, but even when you push the boundaries much further the chances are you&rsquo;ll find it happening in the animal world.</p><p>Take giraffes, for instance. Males, called bulls, make casual visits to various groups over time in search of a cow who might mate with him. In order to select the mating partner the bull literally finds the one that best suits his taste &ndash; by sampling their urine. Females co-operate in this \"urine-testing\" ritual, according to researchers <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00222938500770471\">David M. Pratt and Virginia H. Anderson</a>. &ldquo;When the bull nuzzles her rump, she must produce a stream of urine if he is to catch some in his mouth and savour it,\" they write. If a cow is particularly attracted to a visiting bull, she may simply decide to urinate as he walks past her, no prodding required. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urolagnia\">Urolagnia</a>, or \"golden showers\" as it is more commonly known, is not a human invention, it seems.<strong> <br /></strong></p><p>While giraffes' social decisions are ruled by urine, hippos appear to rely on dung. The function and purpose of dung-showering is still only partially understood, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Behavior-Guide-African-Mammals-Carnivores/dp/0520080858\">according to</a> biologist <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Despard_Estes\">Richard Despard Estes</a>. What&rsquo;s clear is that dominant males defecate in order to mark the boundaries of their territories. University of Alberta scientists EL Karstad and RJ Hudson <a href=\"http://www.degruyter.com/view/j/mamm.1986.50.issue-2/mamm.1986.50.2.153/mamm.1986.50.2.153.xml\">describe</a> one dominant male backing up to the riverbank and \"copiously defecating, scattering dung up to 2 metres in radius by flapping its tail vigorously.\" But there's more to hippo dung than <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2011/03/10/defending_your_territory_be_sm/\">simple territory demarcation</a>. When territorial males approach females they respond in a manner known as \"submissive defecation\". In this impressive display, the female turns around, lowering her head while raising her rear, then slowly wags her tail while defecating. In situations like this, dung-showering is thought to serve as a sign of submission.</p><p>Sexual fantasies aren't limited to urine and faeces, of course. Some people prefer their sexual encounters a little more on the rough side, but this is nothing compared with the blacktip reef shark (Carcharhinus melanopterus) found in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific oceans. For them, sex has an added bite.</p><p>Stanford biologist Douglas J McCauley and colleagues carefully described the <a href=\"http://www.bioone.org/doi/abs/10.2984/64.2.349\">mating habits</a> of this toothy species in 2010. After being followed through the water at close distance by a group of males, a female was bitten on her tail by the lead male. While the tail bite slowed her down, she managed to briefly free herself before being bitten again, by the same male, on her body near her right pectoral fin. Having got hold of her, he guided her head into the sandy seafloor long enough to insert one of his two claspers into her cloaca, resulting in a sixty-eight second copulation. Shark scientist David Shiffman <a href=\"http://www.southernfriedscience.com/?p=14393\">pointed out recently</a> that biting may be a necessary consequence of mating in a three-dimensional &ndash; and slippery &ndash; environment. \"It ensures that the male remains close enough to the female to copulate.\" Female sharks of many species may have evolved thicker, tougher skin than males for this very reason.</p><p>Group sex appears to be another evolutionary strategy. Every spring in southern Manitoba, tens of thousands of red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis parietalis) emerge from their underground hibernation dens and end up writhing in large &ldquo;mating balls&rdquo;. When a female garter snake emerges, she releases a pheromone that attracts hundreds of male snakes towards her. As if that isn't enough, scientists discovered that some male snakes &ldquo;cross dress&rdquo;; they release female-like pheromones to attract other males. One common assumption has been that pheromone-releasing males gain a reproductive advantage by diverting fellow male snakes attention from the female. But Australian and US researchers think this solves a <a href=\"http://people.oregonstate.edu/%7Emasonr/pdfs/064advantageoffemale.pdf\">more mundane purpose</a> &ndash; male snakes pose as females to warm up quicker and to reduce their exposure to predators.</p><p>The mourning cuttlefish (<em>Sepia plangon</em>) takes its cross dressing even further. This cephalopod, found in the waters off the eastern coast of Australia, controls the appearance of its skin <a href=\"http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2012/07/03/cuttlefish-woos-female-and-dupes-male-with-split-personality-skin/\">with exquisite precision</a>. When a male cuttlefish attempts to seduce a nearby female, he offers her a courtship display by controlling the arrangement of pigments that appear on the surface of his skin. If a rival male approaches, he changes his skin on the side facing the rival to appear female. The female still sees the courtship display, the intruder, however, thinks there are two females &ndash; leaving the original male to complete his reproductive business in peace.</p><p>Our societies may look down upon certain sexual interests as odd, weird, gross, or just plain silly. But as with <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130123-what-are-friends-really-for\">friendships</a>, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130109-why-do-animals-like-to-play\">play</a>, and even <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20121211-animals-that-seek-teenage-kicks\">teenage kicks</a>, investigating other species helps us to hold a magnifying glass of sorts &ndash; albeit one with a bit of distortion &ndash; up to our own behaviours. And if we squint real hard and tilt our heads to the side we might be able to catch a glimpse of the common threads connecting us with our non-human cousins. Even if it offends or challenges our norms.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook page</em></a><em> or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-02-22T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The wilder side of sex","HeadlineShort":"The wilder side of sex","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Humans may look down upon certain sexual interests as odd or gross, though chances are that animals indulge in a spot of similar behaviour too.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Humans may look down upon certain sexual interests as odd or gross, though chances are that animals indulge in a spot of similar behaviour too.","SummaryShort":"Fantasy in the animal world","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"8c3334d5-36a8-48b1-923e-ce603d2792f4","Id":"wwfuture/story/20130221-the-wilder-side-of-sex","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:16:50Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20130221-the-wilder-side-of-sex"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20130221-the-wilder-side-of-sex","_id":"55dc6363e2b83951eb996ac0"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>An eight-year-old juvenile chimpanzee named Kakama trudged along a path among the forest trees, following his pregnant mother. A scientist sat silently at a distance, watching Kakama pick up a log and carry it with him for hours. At one point, Kakama made a nest and placed the log in it, as if it were a small chimpanzee. Months later, two field assistants observed the same thing: Kakama was playing with a similar log, which they labelled \"Kakama's toy baby.\"</p><p>Was Kakama simply confused? Did he really think that the log was a smaller version of himself? Or did Kakama know that the log was really a log, and was only pretending that the log was a baby?</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanzi\">Kanzi</a>, the famous bonobo, liked to pretend as well. Primatologist Sue Savage-Rumbaugh <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1988-98392-017\">described</a> watching Kanzi hide invisible objects under blankets or leaves, later removing them from their hiding spots, and pretending to eat them. \"Kanzi also engages the participation of others\" in these games, Savage-Rumbaugh notes, \"by giving them the pretend object and watching to see what they do with it.\"</p><p>From an early age, human children act out imagined scenes that conflict with reality. Psychologist Robert W Mitchell <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pretending-Imagination-Animals-Children-Mitchell/dp/0521283329\">calls</a> children \"proto-typical pretenders\", and he writes that pretend play, or make-believe, is \"a mental activity involving imagination\". Which is, admittedly, useless as a definition.</p><p>Dreams could be thought of as being one form of imagination. When researchers measured the brain activity of rats as they were learning to navigate a maze, they saw the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n1/abs/nn1825.html\">same firing pattern</a> while they were asleep as when they were awake. The rats were running through the mazes in their sleep &ndash; it was as if someone had pressed the rewind button on a brain activity recorder, and pressed play.</p><p>But pretending or \"make believe\" requires a bit more mental complexity than that. One kind of pretence involves imagining that one object, such as a banana, is actually a second type of object, such as a telephone, or imagining that a lifeless object such as a doll is actually animate &ndash; both of which were observed with Kakama.</p><p><strong>Flights of fantasy</strong></p><p>Another type of pretence involves imagining an object that isn't even there in the first place, such as when children (or adults) play air guitar. An illuminating example of this sort of imagination comes from a chimpanzee named Viki who was raised in a human home. Viki had lots of toys, including some attached to strings that could be pulled along. Primatologists Mary Lee Jensvold and Roger Fouts <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02436716\">recount</a> the original description of Viki's behaviour: \"Very slowly and deliberately she was marching around the toilet, trailing the fingertips of one hand on the floor. Now and then she paused, glanced back at her hand, and then resumed her progress&hellip; She trudged along just this busily on two feet and one hand, while the other arm extended backward this way to pull the toy. Viki had an imaginary pulltoy!\" And not only that. Viki sometimes acted as if her pulltoy had got stuck on something. She tugged on the invisible string until she imagined that the toy had gotten free. Once, when her invisible toy was \"stuck\", she waited until her human caregiver pretended to free the toy, before continuing to play with it.</p><p>Some of the more charming examples of animal imagination come from the female gorilla <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_%28gorilla%29\">Koko</a>, who was trained to use American Sign Language. Koko routinely pretended that her dolls were her companions, frequently tried to nurse them, and often signed to them, sometimes giving them instructions. In one instance, a five-year-old Koko orchestrated an exchange between two toy gorillas, one blue and one pink. First, looking at the pink gorilla, she signed BAD BAD and then KISS towards the blue one. She then instructed the pair of toys to CHASE and TICKLE before smacking the two dolls together. After wrestling with each doll, Koko stopped and signed, GOOD GORILLA. GOOD GOOD.</p><p>Another time, a caregiver showed the ten-year-old Koko a photo of a bird in a magazine. THAT ME, Koko signed. \"Is that really you?\" KOKO GOOD BIRD, she responded. \"I thought you were a gorilla.\" KOKO BIRD. The caregiver asked, \"you sure?\" Koko responded, pointing to the bird, KOKO GOOD THAT. \"Okay, I must be a gorilla,\" the caregiver said. BIRD YOU, the gorilla signed. \"We're both birds?\" Koko responded by signing GOOD. \"Show me,\" the caregiver prodded. FAKE BIRD CLOWN. \"You're teasing me. What are you really?\" Finally, Koko gave in, with a laugh: GORILLA KOKO.</p><p>By pretending to be a bird, Koko is doing something that the youngest human infants can't do. Young infants attempt to grasp objects in pictures as if they're really there. But by nineteen months, on average, grasping is <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/9/3/205.short\">replaced</a> by pointing. By that age, human infants begin to understand that a picture is a representation of another object, not the object itself, much the same as a ten-year-old Koko understood that she wasn't truly a bird.</p><p>On the other hand, children under four years seem able to pretend in some instances but not in others. For instance, three-year-old children <a href=\"http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jbem34&amp;div=41&amp;id=&amp;page=\">routinely agree</a> that a balloon on a television screen would float to the ceiling if the top of the set was removed.</p><p>Koko, too, in some instances couldn&rsquo;t distinguish between pretence and reality. In one interaction, a caregiver brought a toy dinosaur and hid it between her legs as she sat with the eleven-year-old ape. The caregiver poked the toy dinosaur out from behind her legs, causing Koko to jump backwards. \"I scared you!\" said the caregiver, \"what's this?\" Koko answered FAKETOOTH FAKE. \"Yes, it's a fake alligator.\" Dinosaurs, lizards and alligators are all labelled \"alligator\" in Koko's vocabulary. After playing with the toy for a while, the caregiver asked, \"You like it? You want it?\" Koko responded GOOD, but still she didn't take it. The caregiver pretended as if the toy bit her own finger, shouting \"Ow!\" as if in pain. TOILET STINK, Koko replied. \"Give me your finger, Koko,\" the caregiver instructs. But Koko instead offered a toy doll, letting it get bitten instead. \"You funny Koko, let monster bite doll instead of you. Let's try being nice to it. It's a nice animal.\" The caregiver kissed the doll, to which Koko responded with the sign FAKETOOTH. \"You want to kiss it, be nice?\" While Koko eventually, though cautiously, kissed the dinosaur, she quickly withdrew.</p><p>Koko seemed aware that the dinosaur was only a toy, using the signs FAKE and FAKETOOTH, both of which she regularly used to indicate that objects aren't real. However, she was also scared of it, acting quite wary about touching or kissing it. On some level, perhaps, she thought that the toy dinosaur could actually harm her.</p><p><strong>Mind games</strong></p><p>Like a human child under four years of age, it might be that Koko didn't understand the concept of pretending, or didn't apply her knowledge of pretence uniformly. Despite the fact that she knew and understood the sign for \"pretend\", Koko more often used the signs for \"know\" and \"think\" when asked about her toys.</p><p>That said, one does not have to be aware that they are pretending in order to successfully pretend. In one clever <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8477622\">study</a>, researchers asked human children if a troll that hopped like a rabbit was only pretending to be a rabbit, even if he had never heard of rabbits in the first place. It wasn't until children were at least four years old that they answered correctly, suggesting that the younger children did not yet understand that pretending was something associated with the mind rather than the body.</p><p>To the extent that animals like Kakama, Kanzi, Viki, and Koko can pretend, their imaginations are probably limited in the same way as young human children. They can imagine, though they might not have a complete awareness of the distinctions between reality and fantasy. They might pretend, but not recognize it as such. Decades of intensive observation have revealed that under some circumstances, animals can imagine the future or the past, can pay attention to imaginary objects, and can pretend that one object is another. In some extraordinary circumstances, non-human animals have been known to feign interest or emotion, a type of pretence, in order to distract a rival from food or a mate.</p><p>One type of make-believe that has never been observed in an animal, though, is the sustained relationship with an imaginary other. To the best of our knowledge, no animal has an invisible friend. Still, the likes of Kakama, Kanzi, Viki, and Koko show that even imagination, something that Carl Sagan wrote could \"carry us to worlds that never were,\" is far from uniquely human.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook page</a> or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-02-07T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Do animals have imagination?","HeadlineShort":"Can animals imagine?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Decades of intensive studies have revealed that chimpanzees and other species can pretend.

A scientist sat silently at a distance, watching Kakama pick up a log and carry it with him for hours. At one point, Kakama made a nest and placed the log in it, as if it were a small chimpanzee. Months later, two field assistants observed the same thing: Kakama was playing with a similar log, which they labelled \"Kakama's toy baby.\"</p><p>Was Kakama simply confused? Did he really think that the log was a smaller version of himself? Or did Kakama know that the log was really a log, and was only pretending that the log was a baby?</p><p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanzi\">Kanzi</a>, the famous bonobo, liked to pretend as well. Primatologist Sue Savage-Rumbaugh <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1988-98392-017\">described</a> watching Kanzi hide invisible objects under blankets or leaves, later removing them from their hiding spots, and pretending to eat them. \"Kanzi also engages the participation of others\" in these games, Savage-Rumbaugh notes, \"by giving them the pretend object and watching to see what they do with it.\"</p><p>From an early age, human children act out imagined scenes that conflict with reality. Psychologist Robert W Mitchell <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Pretending-Imagination-Animals-Children-Mitchell/dp/0521283329\">calls</a> children \"proto-typical pretenders\", and he writes that pretend play, or make-believe, is \"a mental activity involving imagination\". Which is, admittedly, useless as a definition.</p><p>Dreams could be thought of as being one form of imagination. When researchers measured the brain activity of rats as they were learning to navigate a maze, they saw the <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n1/abs/nn1825.html\">same firing pattern</a> while they were asleep as when they were awake. The rats were running through the mazes in their sleep &ndash; it was as if someone had pressed the rewind button on a brain activity recorder, and pressed play.</p><p>But pretending or \"make believe\" requires a bit more mental complexity than that. One kind of pretence involves imagining that one object, such as a banana, is actually a second type of object, such as a telephone, or imagining that a lifeless object such as a doll is actually animate &ndash; both of which were observed with Kakama.</p><p><strong>Flights of fantasy</strong></p><p>Another type of pretence involves imagining an object that isn't even there in the first place, such as when children (or adults) play air guitar. An illuminating example of this sort of imagination comes from a chimpanzee named Viki who was raised in a human home. Viki had lots of toys, including some attached to strings that could be pulled along. Primatologists Mary Lee Jensvold and Roger Fouts <a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF02436716\">recount</a> the original description of Viki's behaviour: \"Very slowly and deliberately she was marching around the toilet, trailing the fingertips of one hand on the floor. Now and then she paused, glanced back at her hand, and then resumed her progress&hellip; She trudged along just this busily on two feet and one hand, while the other arm extended backward this way to pull the toy. Viki had an imaginary pulltoy!\" And not only that. Viki sometimes acted as if her pulltoy had got stuck on something. She tugged on the invisible string until she imagined that the toy had gotten free. Once, when her invisible toy was \"stuck\", she waited until her human caregiver pretended to free the toy, before continuing to play with it.</p><p>Some of the more charming examples of animal imagination come from the female gorilla <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koko_%28gorilla%29\">Koko</a>, who was trained to use American Sign Language. Koko routinely pretended that her dolls were her companions, frequently tried to nurse them, and often signed to them, sometimes giving them instructions. In one instance, a five-year-old Koko orchestrated an exchange between two toy gorillas, one blue and one pink. First, looking at the pink gorilla, she signed BAD BAD and then KISS towards the blue one. She then instructed the pair of toys to CHASE and TICKLE before smacking the two dolls together. After wrestling with each doll, Koko stopped and signed, GOOD GORILLA. GOOD GOOD.</p><p>Another time, a caregiver showed the ten-year-old Koko a photo of a bird in a magazine. THAT ME, Koko signed. \"Is that really you?\" KOKO GOOD BIRD, she responded. \"I thought you were a gorilla.\" KOKO BIRD. The caregiver asked, \"you sure?\" Koko responded, pointing to the bird, KOKO GOOD THAT. \"Okay, I must be a gorilla,\" the caregiver said. BIRD YOU, the gorilla signed. \"We're both birds?\" Koko responded by signing GOOD. \"Show me,\" the caregiver prodded. FAKE BIRD CLOWN. \"You're teasing me. What are you really?\" Finally, Koko gave in, with a laugh: GORILLA KOKO.</p><p>By pretending to be a bird, Koko is doing something that the youngest human infants can't do. Young infants attempt to grasp objects in pictures as if they're really there. But by nineteen months, on average, grasping is <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/9/3/205.short\">replaced</a> by pointing. By that age, human infants begin to understand that a picture is a representation of another object, not the object itself, much the same as a ten-year-old Koko understood that she wasn't truly a bird.</p><p>On the other hand, children under four years seem able to pretend in some instances but not in others. For instance, three-year-old children <a href=\"http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/jbem34&amp;div=41&amp;id=&amp;page=\">routinely agree</a> that a balloon on a television screen would float to the ceiling if the top of the set was removed.</p><p>Koko, too, in some instances couldn&rsquo;t distinguish between pretence and reality. In one interaction, a caregiver brought a toy dinosaur and hid it between her legs as she sat with the eleven-year-old ape. The caregiver poked the toy dinosaur out from behind her legs, causing Koko to jump backwards. \"I scared you!\" said the caregiver, \"what's this?\" Koko answered FAKETOOTH FAKE. \"Yes, it's a fake alligator.\" Dinosaurs, lizards and alligators are all labelled \"alligator\" in Koko's vocabulary. After playing with the toy for a while, the caregiver asked, \"You like it? You want it?\" Koko responded GOOD, but still she didn't take it. The caregiver pretended as if the toy bit her own finger, shouting \"Ow!\" as if in pain. TOILET STINK, Koko replied. \"Give me your finger, Koko,\" the caregiver instructs. But Koko instead offered a toy doll, letting it get bitten instead. \"You funny Koko, let monster bite doll instead of you. Let's try being nice to it. It's a nice animal.\" The caregiver kissed the doll, to which Koko responded with the sign FAKETOOTH. \"You want to kiss it, be nice?\" While Koko eventually, though cautiously, kissed the dinosaur, she quickly withdrew.</p><p>Koko seemed aware that the dinosaur was only a toy, using the signs FAKE and FAKETOOTH, both of which she regularly used to indicate that objects aren't real. However, she was also scared of it, acting quite wary about touching or kissing it. On some level, perhaps, she thought that the toy dinosaur could actually harm her.</p><p><strong>Mind games</strong></p><p>Like a human child under four years of age, it might be that Koko didn't understand the concept of pretending, or didn't apply her knowledge of pretence uniformly. Despite the fact that she knew and understood the sign for \"pretend\", Koko more often used the signs for \"know\" and \"think\" when asked about her toys.</p><p>That said, one does not have to be aware that they are pretending in order to successfully pretend. In one clever <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8477622\">study</a>, researchers asked human children if a troll that hopped like a rabbit was only pretending to be a rabbit, even if he had never heard of rabbits in the first place. It wasn't until children were at least four years old that they answered correctly, suggesting that the younger children did not yet understand that pretending was something associated with the mind rather than the body.</p><p>To the extent that animals like Kakama, Kanzi, Viki, and Koko can pretend, their imaginations are probably limited in the same way as young human children. They can imagine, though they might not have a complete awareness of the distinctions between reality and fantasy. They might pretend, but not recognize it as such. Decades of intensive observation have revealed that under some circumstances, animals can imagine the future or the past, can pay attention to imaginary objects, and can pretend that one object is another. In some extraordinary circumstances, non-human animals have been known to feign interest or emotion, a type of pretence, in order to distract a rival from food or a mate.</p><p>One type of make-believe that has never been observed in an animal, though, is the sustained relationship with an imaginary other. To the best of our knowledge, no animal has an invisible friend. Still, the likes of Kakama, Kanzi, Viki, and Koko show that even imagination, something that Carl Sagan wrote could \"carry us to worlds that never were,\" is far from uniquely human.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook page</a> or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Our animal behaviour uncovered.

An intricate dance begins, as if each movement was precisely choreographed. The dogs visually inspect each other, sniff each other, walk circles around each other. And then the fight begins. But is it really a fight, or is it just play-fighting? It's very important for Fido and you to know whether he's in any true danger.</p><p>Dog owners everywhere like to take their dogs to the park to play. But is their behaviour best described as \"play\"? Scientists, such as <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Animal-Scientific-American-Library-Paperback/dp/0716760355\">James L. Gould and Carol Grant Gould</a> have used the word &ldquo;play&rdquo; to describe any behaviour that does not have any apparent adaptive function, that is, it serves no obvious purpose.</p><p>The natural world teems with examples of such \"purposeless activities.\" University of Vermont biologists Bernd Heinrich and Rachel Smolker <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?index=books&amp;linkCode=qs&amp;keywords=0521586569\">describe</a> a commonplace activity among ravens (Corvus corax): <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/2012/01/16/snowboarding-crows-the-plot-thickens/\">snowboarding</a>. Ravens in Alaska and Northern Canada are known to slide down steep, snow-covered roofs. When they reach the bottom, they walk or fly back to the top, and repeat the process over and over again. In Maine, ravens were observed tumbling down small mounds of snow, sometimes while holding sticks between their talons. \"We see no obvious utilitarian function for sliding behaviour,\" they write. Anyone who has spent time in a school playground will recognize that ravens and human children both delight in this type of repetitive sliding activity.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com.libproxy.usc.edu/science/article/pii/S0003347201919037\">Herring gulls</a> (Larus argentatus), too, like to play, but it&rsquo;s not them that take any risks. These shorebirds feed on clams by dropping them onto hard surfaces such as rocks or paved roads. If they drop them from high enough, the clamshell might crack, providing access to the juicy snack waiting inside. Sometimes, rather than letting clams drop to the ground, herring gulls try to catch the clam in mid-air. Other shorebirds play this game of catch as well, including black-backed gulls, common gulls, and Pacific gulls.</p><p>After observing herring gulls for eighty hours, researchers Jennifer R. Gamble and Daniel A. Cristol from the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia, formulated some &ldquo;rules&rdquo; of the game. They found that younger gulls played drop-catch more often than mature gulls. They also found that the drop-catch was performed over soft ground more often than over hard or rocky surfaces. In other words, if the gull had dropped the clams on the softer ground, it was extremely unlikely that they would break open. They also noticed that drop-catch behaviour was far more likely to occur when the gull was carrying an object that wasn't a clam. And drop-catched clams were less likely to be eaten than dropped ones. Most interesting was that drop-catches were more common when the wind was stronger, providing a provocative hint that this may be more enjoyable for gulls when it is a more challenging task. It may be that drop-catching gulls are simply having fun.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Practice makes perfect</strong></p><p>Both the snowboarding ravens and the drop-catching gulls are examples of solitary play, but social play is also common. This brings us back to the dog park play-fight, and another important aspect of animal play, which ethologist Robert Fagen <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2459614\">described</a> as being \"specific signal patterns.\" Dogs and their canid cousins, wolves and coyotes, bow their heads down &ndash; a signal that psychologist <a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/animal-emotions\">Marc Bekoff</a> calls a \"play bow.\" The play bow, like other signals, serves as a means of broadcasting the message, \"I want to play!\" They serve another important function: they maintain on-going play. This is important, since several behaviours used during play are also used in other contexts, like aggressive, predatory, and sexual encounters. In fact, Bekoff <a href=\"http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/10.1163/156853995x00649\">found</a> that the bow is used more often before and after actions that could be misinterpreted as non-playful &ndash; infant and adult dogs used the play bow directly before and after mock bites 74% of the time, juvenile wolves 79% of the time, and young coyotes 92% of the time.</p><p>It is easy to see that play may sometimes have a purpose that is perhaps masked by the lack of any adaptive or evolutionary function. Given that young animals borrow actions from aggressive, hunting, foraging, or sexual behaviours, play may serve as a form of practice. Play might help animals become more psychologically flexible. Fagen argues that: \"the distinctive aspect of playful practice and learning is that they are generic and variational, requiring varied experiences and stressing interactions between simple components.\" If this is the case, then perhaps the variation within &ldquo;play actions&rdquo; may better prepare an animal to respond adequately in future aggressive or sexual encounters.</p><p>So next time you walk by a playground or schoolyard, take a look around. The kinds of games that young children play may echo simpler forms of play seen in animals as different from us as seagulls and coyotes. Some children may remind you of the drop-catching seagull or snowboarding raven, just trying to have a good time. Other games, though, might have a deeper purpose, helping children learn their place in the social world within which they live.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook page</a> or message us on <a href=\"http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-01-09T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why do animals like to play?","HeadlineShort":"Why do animals like to play?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Recreation may look like it serves no obvious purpose, but when dogs and other animals are having fun they are learning some valuable lessons.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Recreation may look like it serves no obvious purpose, but when dogs and other animals are having fun they are learning some valuable lessons.","SummaryShort":"The serious purpose behind having fun","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:13:50Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"e3d9a942-f0b7-4549-8cf5-02abb870be2e","Id":"wwfuture/story/20130109-why-do-animals-like-to-play","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:13:50Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20130109-why-do-animals-like-to-play"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20130109-why-do-animals-like-to-play","_id":"55dc636be2b83951eb996e42"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that Flipper?

See you tomorrow.\"</p><p>Dolphins hold a particular fascination; we are captivated by their intelligence and beauty, and swimming with dolphins features regularly on lists of things to do before you die. <a href=\"http://home.earthlink.net/%7Edherzingfau/\">Denise Herzing</a> has a lifetime of such experiences. For the last 27 years, she has been swimming with a group of Atlantic spotted dolphins in Florida as part of the <a href=\"http://www.wilddolphinproject.org/\">Wild Dolphin Project</a>. She can identify every individual and they, in turn, seem to trust and recognise her. It is a solid foundation for the boldest attempt yet to talk with dolphins.</p><p><strong>One-way chat</strong></p><p>&ldquo;Talk&rdquo; is tricky to define. A SeaWorld trainer who prompts a dolphin to jump for fish is arguably communicating with it. But such simple one-way interactions are a far cry from the conversational world of Dr Doolittle. Here, the dolphin responds, but says nothing intelligible back. Herzing&rsquo;s vision is much more ambitious &ndash; she wants to establish two-way communication with her dolphins, with both species exchanging and understanding information.</p><p>The idea of talking to dolphins has a long and chequered history. It was widely publicised in the 1960s by <a href=\"http://www.johnclilly.com/\">John Lilly</a>, who argued that dolphins have such large brains that they must be extremely intelligent and have a natural language. All we had to do was to &ldquo;crack the code&rdquo;. Much of Lilly&rsquo;s work was highly questionable. He once flooded a house to keep a captive dolphin, instigated failed attempts to teach them spoken English, and even gave the animals LSD (while taking the drug himself). But there is no denying his influence in popularising the idea of two-way dolphin communication. &ldquo;He said that in a few years, we will have established complex dialogue with them,&rdquo; says <a href=\"http://www.dolphincommunicationproject.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=27&amp;Itemid=38\">Justin Gregg</a> from the Dolphin Communication Project. &ldquo;And he was saying that every few years.&rdquo;</p><p>Lilly was right about dolphin intelligence, but not dolphin language. A <a href=\"http://www.dolphincommunicationproject.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1103&amp;Itemid=135\">true language</a> involves small elements that combine into larger chains, to convey complex, and sometimes abstract, information. And there is no good evidence that dolphins have that, despite their rich repertoire of whistles and clicks.</p><p><strong>Little less conversation</strong></p><p>Wild dolphin communication is hard to study. They are fast-moving and hard to follow. They travel in groups, making it hard to assign any call to a specific individual. And they communicate at frequencies beyond what humans can hear. Despite these challenges, there is some evidence that dolphins use sounds to represent concepts. Each individual has its own &ldquo;signature whistle&rdquo; which might act like a name. Developed in the first year of life, dolphins use these whistles as badges of identity, and may modulate them to reflect motivation and mood. This year, a study showed that when wild dolphins meet, one member of each group <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/notrocketscience/2012/02/28/when-meeting-up-at-sea-bottlenose-dolphins-exchange-name-like-whistles/\">exchanges signature whistles</a>.</p><p>But beyond this, dolphin chat is still largely mysterious. &ldquo;To communicate with dolphins, we need to understand how they communicate with each other in the natural world,&rdquo; says psychologist <a href=\"http://www.usm.edu/experimental-psychology/faculty/stan-kuczaj\">Stan Kuczaj</a> at the University of Southern Mississippi. &ldquo;We still don&rsquo;t know basic things like what the units of dolphin communication are. Is a whistle the equivalent of a &ldquo;word&rdquo; or a &ldquo;short sentence&rdquo;? We don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p><p>We may not be able to understand them yet, but we know that dolphins can learn to understand us. In the 1970s, Louis Herman taught an <a href=\"http://www.dolphin-institute.org/resource_guide/animal_language.htm\">invented sign language</a>, complete with basic syntax, to a bottlenose dolphin called Akeakamai. For example, if he made the gestures for &ldquo;person surfboard fetch&rdquo;, Akeakamai would bring the board to him, while &ldquo;surfboard person fetch&rdquo; would prompt her to carry the person to the board. His experiments showed that dolphins could understand hundreds of words, and how those words could be combined using grammatical rules.</p><p><strong>What&rsquo;s my motivation?</strong></p><p>Herman&rsquo;s work was groundbreaking, but this was still one-way communication. It focused on comprehension, not conversation. In the 1980s, <a href=\"http://www.hunter.cuny.edu/psychology/faculty/the-faculty-folder/reiss\">Diana Reiss</a> had more luck by showing that dolphins could use <a href=\"http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GRUY468Z13QC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;dq=diana+reiss+keyboard&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8l3K8imyYR&amp;sig=n4bq1EtTBY4gBfm3Y88HvLrXPr0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3xNrT5uDI8XS0QXo89y7Bg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=diana%20reiss%20keyboard&amp;f=f\">underwater keyboards</a> to make basic requests. When they prodded keys with their snouts, a whistle would play and Reiss gave a reward like a ball. Eventually, the dolphins used the artificial whistles to ask for the associated rewards. &nbsp;</p><p>But as conversations go, these were shallow ones. &ldquo;The dolphins were only really interested in communicating about needs that they had, like a tool they needed or a fish they wanted,&rdquo; says Kuczaj, who was involved in a similar project at DisneyWorld&rsquo;s EPCOT Center. &ldquo;We hoped they would also comment on other things going on in the aquarium but they didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p><p>It is difficult persuading dolphins to learn some arbitrary signals, like a whistle signifying a ball, and then use them in a social context, admits Gregg. &ldquo;They don&rsquo;t seem to run with it the same way that chimps or bonobos have. The big stumbling block is motivation. Dolphins don&rsquo;t seem to care.&rdquo;</p><p>Herzing disagrees. She notes that captive animals, which often lack stimulation, will respond to systems like the underwater keyboards. She thinks that these experiments disappointed because they were cumbersome. &ldquo;The dolphins swim very fast and went to where they were requested, but humans are very slow in the water. There wasn&rsquo;t enough real-time interaction.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Chat line</strong></p><p>Herzing is trying to solve that problem with Cetacean Hearing and Telemetry (CHAT) &ndash; a lighter, portable version of the underwater keyboards. It consists of a small phone-sized computer, strapped to a diver&rsquo;s chest and connected to two underwater recorders, or hydrophones. The computer will detect and differentiate dolphin sounds, including the ultrasonic ones we cannot hear, and use flashing lights to tell the diver which animal made the call.</p><p>The CHAT device can also play artificial calls, allowing Herzing to coin dolphin-esque &ldquo;words&rdquo; for things that are relevant to them, like &ldquo;seaweed&rdquo; or &ldquo;wave-surfing\". She hopes the dolphins will mimic the artificial whistles, and use them voluntarily. By working with wild animals, and focusing on objects in their natural environment, rather than balls or hoops, Herzing hopes to pique their interest.</p><p>Herzing emphasises that her device is not a translator. It will not act as a dolphin-human Rosetta stone. Instead, she wants both species create a joint form of communication that they are both invested in. She hopes that CHAT will tap into the &ldquo;natural propensity&rdquo; that dolphins have &ldquo;for creating common information when they have to interact&rdquo;. For example, in Costa Rica, distantly related bottlenose and Guyana dolphins will adopt a <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_9045000/9045389.stm\">shared collection of sounds</a> when they come together, using sounds that they don&rsquo;t use when apart.</p><p>As with past projects, all of this depends on whether the dolphins play along. Kuczaj says, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a remarkable challenge because she is working with wild dolphins so they&rsquo;ve got the option to participate or not.&rdquo; Here, Herzing has an edge, since the animals know her, and vice versa. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been observing them underwater every summer since 1985,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I know the individuals personally &ndash; their personalities and relationships. We&rsquo;ve got a pretty good handle on what they&rsquo;d be interested in.&rdquo; Perhaps this combination of cutting-edge technology and old-school fieldwork will finally produce the conversations that have eluded scientists for so long.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook page</a> or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2012-03-23T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Will we ever... talk to the animals?","HeadlineShort":"Will we ever... talk to animals?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"History is littered with animals who have \"communicated\" with humans, but as work with dolphins shows it is difficult to strike up a two-way conversation.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"History is littered with animals who have \"communicated\" with humans, but as work with dolphins shows it is difficult to strike up a two-way conversation.","SummaryShort":"Work with dolphins show it is difficult to strike up a two-way conversation","Tag":null},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"89659f89-aaca-4fec-b5f8-91c39ee88580","Id":"wwfuture/story/20120322-will-we-ever-talk-to-animals","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20120322-will-we-ever-talk-to-animals"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20120322-will-we-ever-talk-to-animals","_id":"55dc6361e2b83951eb9969bc"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"ib2video","AssetVideoIb2":[],"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":null,"BodyHtml":"<p>Laurel Braitman, a science historian and <a href=\"http://animalmadness.com/\"><strong>author</strong></a>, has taken the slightly surreal step of organising live music in zoos to try to help answer those questions.</p><p>She says the events have begun to shed light on the individuality of different animals.</p><p>She tells BBC Future how she envisions a future where we understand what is going on in an animal&rsquo;s head, something she says throws up questions about our treatment of different species.</p><p>&nbsp;<em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><strong>Facebook page</strong></a> or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"><strong>Twitter</strong></a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:01Z","HeadlineLong":"Understanding the animal mind... through music","HeadlineShort":"Musically-minded animals","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Do animals respond to music?

It's a question that has repeatedly been asked throughout humanity. For thousands of years, philosophers have debated whether we have a basically good nature that is corrupted by society, or a basically bad nature that is kept in check by society. Psychology has uncovered some evidence which might give the old debate a twist.</p><p>One way of asking about our most fundamental characteristics is to look at babies. Babies' minds are a wonderful showcase for human nature. Babies are humans with the absolute minimum of cultural influence &ndash; they don't have many friends, have never been to school and haven't read any books. They can't even control their own bowels, let alone speak the language, so their minds are as close to innocent as a human mind can get.</p><p>The only problem is that the lack of language makes it tricky to gauge their opinions. Normally we ask people to take part in experiments, giving them instructions or asking them to answer questions, both of which require language. Babies may be cuter to work with, but they are not known for their obedience. What's a curious psychologist to do?</p><p>Fortunately, you don't necessarily have to speak to reveal your opinions. Babies will reach for things they want or like, and they will tend to look longer at things that surprise them. Ingenious experiments <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v450/n7169/full/nature06288.html\">carried out at Yale University</a> in the US used these measures to look at babies' minds. Their results suggest that even the youngest humans have a sense of right and wrong, and, furthermore, an instinct to prefer good over evil.</p><p>How could the experiments tell this? Imagine you are a baby. Since you have a short attention span, the experiment will be shorter and loads more fun than most psychology experiments. It was basically a kind of puppet show; the stage a scene featuring a bright green hill, and the puppets were cut-out shapes with stick on wobbly eyes; a triangle, a square and a circle, each in their own bright colours. What happened next was a short play, as one of the shapes tried to climb the hill, struggling up and falling back down again. Next, the other two shapes got involved, with either one helping the climber up the hill, by pushing up from behind, or the other hindering the climber, by pushing back from above.</p><p>Already something amazing, psychologically, is going on here. All humans are able to interpret the events in the play in terms of the story I&rsquo;ve described. The puppets are just shapes. They don't make human sounds or display human emotions. They just move about, and yet everyone reads these movements as purposeful, and revealing of their characters. You can argue that this &ldquo;mind reading&rdquo;, even in infants, shows that it is part of our human nature to believe in other minds.</p><p><strong>Great expectations</strong></p><p>What happened next tells us even more about human nature. After the show, infants were given the choice of reaching for either the helping or the hindering shape, and it turned out they were much more likely to reach for the helper. This can be explained if they are reading the events of the show in terms of motivations &ndash; the shapes aren't just moving at random, but they showed to the infant that the shape pushing uphill \"wants\" to help out (and so is nice) and the shape pushing downhill \"wants\" to cause problems (and so is nasty).</p><p>The researchers used an encore to confirm these results. Infants saw a second scene in which the climber shape made a choice to move towards either the helper shape or the hinderer shape. The time infants spent looking in each of the two cases revealed what they thought of the outcome. If the climber moved towards the hinderer the infants looked significantly longer than if the climber moved towards the helper. This makes sense if the infants were surprised when the climber approached the hinderer. Moving towards the helper shape would be the happy ending, and obviously it was what the infant expected. If the climber moved towards the hinderer it was a surprise, as much as you or I would be surprised if we saw someone give a hug to a man who had just knocked him over.</p><p>The way to make sense of this result is if infants, with their pre-cultural brains had expectations about how people should act. Not only do they interpret the movement of the shapes as resulting from motivations, but they prefer helping motivations over hindering ones.</p><p>This doesn't settle the debate over human nature. A cynic would say that it just shows that infants are self-interested and expect others to be the same way. At a minimum though, it shows that tightly bound into the nature of our developing minds is the ability to make sense of the world in terms of motivations, and a basic instinct to prefer friendly intentions over malicious ones. It is on this foundation that adult morality is built.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/https:/www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook page</a> or message us on <a href=\"http://anonymouse.org/cgi-bin/anon-www.cgi/https:/twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-01-14T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Are we naturally good or bad?","HeadlineShort":"Are we naturally good or bad?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"It's a question humanity has repeatedly asked itself, and one way to find out is to take a closer look at the behaviour of babies.… and use puppets.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"It's a question humanity has repeatedly asked itself, and one way to find out is to take a closer look at the behaviour of babies.… and use puppets.","SummaryShort":"How babies can reveal the answer","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"ae0de38e-7ab7-4682-a4f6-ceb720e7a2a1","Id":"wwfuture/story/20130114-are-we-naturally-good-or-bad","ModifiedDateTime":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20130114-are-we-naturally-good-or-bad"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20130114-are-we-naturally-good-or-bad","_id":"55dc636de2b83951eb996f0f"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>You have probably heard of the Mozart effect. It&rsquo;s the idea that if children or even babies listen to music composed by Mozart they will become more intelligent. A quick internet search reveals plenty of products to assist you in the task. Whatever your age there are CDs and books to help you to harness the power of Mozart&rsquo;s music, but when it comes to scientific evidence that it can make you more clever, the picture is more mixed.&nbsp;</p><p>The phrase &ldquo;the Mozart effect&rdquo; was coined in 1991, but it is a study described two years later in the journal Nature that sparked real media and public interest about the idea that listening to classical music somehow improves the brain. It is one of those ideas that feels plausible. Mozart was undoubtedly a genius himself, his music is complex and there is a hope that if we listen to enough of it, a little of that intelligence might rub off on us.</p><p>The idea took off, with thousands of parents playing Mozart to their children, and in 1998 Zell Miller, the Governor of the state of Georgia in the US, even asked for money to be set aside in the state budget so that every newborn baby could be sent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/15/us/georgia-s-governor-seeks-musical-start-for-babies.html\">a CD of classical music</a>. It&rsquo;s not just babies and children who were deliberately exposed to Mozart&rsquo;s melodies. When Sergio Della Sala, the psychologist and author of the book Mind Myths, visited a mozzarella farm in Italy, the farmer proudly explained that the buffalos were played Mozart three times a day to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016wzs9\">help them to produce better milk</a>.</p><p>I&rsquo;ll leave the debate on the impact on milk yield to farmers, but what about the evidence that listening to Mozart makes people more intelligent? Exactly what was it was that the authors of the initial study discovered that took public imagination by storm?</p><p>When you look back <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6447/abs/365611a0.html\">at the original paper</a>, the first surprise is that the authors from the University of California, Irvine are modest in their claims and don&rsquo;t even use the &ldquo;Mozart effect&rdquo; phrase in the paper. The second surprise is that it wasn&rsquo;t conducted on children at all: it was in fact conducted with those stalwarts of psychological studies &ndash; young adult students. Only 36 students took part. On three occasions they were given a series of mental tasks to complete, and before each task, they listened either to ten minutes of silence, ten minutes of a tape of relaxation instructions, or ten minutes of Mozart&rsquo;s sonata for two pianos in D major (K448).</p><p>The students who listened to Mozart did better at tasks where they had to create shapes in their minds. For a short time the students were better at spatial tasks where they had to look at folded up pieces of paper with cuts in them and to predict how they would appear when unfolded. But unfortunately, as the authors make clear at the time, this effect lasts for about fifteen minutes. So it&rsquo;s hardly going to bring you a lifetime of enhanced intelligence.</p><p><strong>Brain arousal</strong></p><p>Nevertheless, people began to theorise about why it was that Mozart&rsquo;s music in particular could have this effect. Did the complexity of music cause patterns of cortical firing in the brain similar to those associated with solving spatial puzzles?</p><p>More research followed, and a <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6747/full/400826a0.html#B1\">meta-analysis of sixteen different studies</a> confirmed that listening to music does lead to a temporary improvement in the ability to manipulate shapes mentally, but the benefits are short-lived and it doesn&rsquo;t make us more intelligent.</p><p>Then it began to emerge that perhaps Mozart wasn&rsquo;t so special after all. In 2010 a larger meta-analysis of a greater number of studies again found a positive effect, but that <a href=\"http://journals.ohiolink.edu/ejc/article.cgi?issn=01602896&amp;issue=v38i0003&amp;article=314_meeam\">other kinds of music</a> worked just as well<em>. </em>One study found that listening to Schubert was just as good, and so was hearing a passage read out aloud from a Stephen King novel. But only if you enjoyed it. So, perhaps <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/10/4/370.short\">enjoyment and engagement</a> are key, rather than the exact notes you hear.</p><p>Although we tend to associate the Mozart effect with babies and small children, most of these studies were conducted on adults, whose brains are of course at a very different stage of development. But in 2006 a large study was conducted in Britain <a href=\"http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/2294/1/SchellenbergHallam2006Music202.pdf\">involving eight thousand children</a>. They listened either to ten minutes of Mozart&rsquo;s String Quintet in D Major, a discussion about the experiment or to a sequence of three pop songs: Blur&rsquo;s &ldquo;Country House,&rdquo; &ldquo;Return of the Mack,&rdquo; by Mark Morrison and PJ and Duncan&rsquo;s &ldquo;Stepping Stone&rdquo;. Once again music improved the ability to predict paper shapes, but this time it wasn&rsquo;t a Mozart effect, but a Blur effect. The children who listened to Mozart did well, but with pop music they did even better, so prior preference could come into it.</p><p>Whatever your musical choice, it seems that all you need to do a bit better at predictive origami is some cognitive arousal. Your mind needs to get a little more active, it needs something to get it going and that&rsquo;s going to be whichever kind of music appeals to you. In fact, it doesn&rsquo;t have to be music. Anything that makes you more alert should work just as well &ndash; doing a few star jumps or drinking some coffee, for instance.</p><p>There is a way in which music can make a difference to your IQ, though. Unfortunately it requires a bit more effort than putting on a CD. Learning to play a musical instrument can have a beneficial effect on your brain. Jessica Grahn, a cognitive scientist at Western University in London, Ontario says that a year of piano lessons, combined with regular practice can increase IQ by <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b016wzs9\">as much as three points</a>.</p><p>So listening to Mozart won&rsquo;t do you or your children any harm and could be the start of a life-long love of classical music. But unless you and your family have some urgent imaginary origami to do, the chances are that sticking on a sonata is not going to make you better at anything.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook page</a> or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>. </em></p><p><em>You can hear more Medical Myths on <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p002vsyw\">Health Check on the BBC World Service</a>.</em></p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong><strong><br /> </strong>All content within this column is provided for general information only, and should not be treated as a substitute for the medical advice of your own doctor or any other health care professional.

The same unique intelligence and cooperation also underlies more positive advances, such as modern medicine.</p><p>But is that all that defines us? In recent years, many traits once believed to be uniquely human, from morality to culture, have been found in the animal kingdom (see <a href="http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150706-humans-are-not-unique-or-special">part one in this two-part series</a>).

The philosopher Aristotle marked out our differences over 2,000 years ago. We are &quot;<a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/metaphysics.html">rational animals</a>&quot; pursuing knowledge for its own sake. We live by art and reasoning, he wrote. </p><p>Much of what he said stills stands. Yes, we see the roots of many behaviours once considered uniquely human in our closest relatives, chimpanzees and bonobos. But we are the only ones who peer into their world and write books about it.</p><blockquote><p> We see the roots of many behaviours once considered uniquely human in our closest relatives </p></blockquote><p>&quot;Obviously we have similarities. We have similarities with everything else in nature; it would be astonishing if we didn&apos;t. But we&apos;ve got to look at the differences,&quot; says <a href="http://www.amnh.org/our-research/staff-directory/ian-tattersall">Ian Tattersall</a>, a paleoanthropologist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, US.</p><p>To understand these differences, a good place to start is to look at how we got here. Why are we the only human species still alive today whereas many of our early-human ancestors went extinct?</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="Neanderthals (left) didn&apos;t fare as well as we did (Credit: SPL)" data-caption="Neanderthals (left) didn&apos;t fare as well as we did (Credit: SPL)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="Neanderthals (left) didn&apos;t fare as well as we did (Credit: SPL)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2w/d2/p02wd2jc.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of Neanderthals (left) didn&apos;t fare as well as we did (Credit: SPL) </a></div></p><p>Humans and chimpanzees diverged from our common ancestor more than six million years ago. Fossil evidence points to the ways which we have gradually changed. We left the trees, started walking and began to live in larger groups. And then our brains got bigger. Physically we are another primate, but our bigger brains are unusual.</p><p>We don&apos;t know exactly what led to our brains becoming the size they are today, but we seem to owe our complex reasoning abilities to it. <em></em></p><p>It is likely that we have our big brain to thank that we exist at all. When we <em>&#x2013;</em> <em>Homo sapiens &#x2013; </em>first appeared about 200,000 years ago we weren&apos;t alone. We shared the planet at least four other upright cousins; Neanderthals, Denisovans, the &quot;hobbit&quot; <em>Homo floresiensis </em>and <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25423498">a mysterious fourth</a> group.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="The human brain is advantageously big (Credit: Thinkstock)" data-caption="The human brain is advantageously big (Credit: Thinkstock)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="The human brain is advantageously big (Credit: Thinkstock)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2w/d2/p02wd2fv.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of The human brain is advantageously big (Credit: Thinkstock) </a></div></p><p>Evidence in the form of stone tools suggests that for about 100,000 years our technology was very similar to the Neanderthals. But 80,000 years ago something changed.</p><p>&quot;The Neanderthals had an impressive but basically routine material record for a hominid. Once <em>H. sapiens</em> started behaving in a strange, [more sophisticated] way, all hell broke loose and change became the norm,&quot; Tattersall says.</p><p>We started to produce superior cultural and technological artefacts. Our stone tools became more intricate. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1162219">One study proposes</a> that our technological innovation was key for our migration out of Africa. We started to assign symbolic values to objects such as <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/science/2012/dec/09/ice-age-art-exhibition-british-museum">geometrical designs on plaques</a> and cave art.</p><blockquote><p> There is little evidence that any other hominins made any kind of art </p></blockquote><p>By contrast, there is little evidence that any other hominins made any kind of art. One example, which was possibly made by Neanderthals, was hailed as proof they had similar levels of abstract thought. However, it is a simple etching and some question <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/neanderthals-made-some-of-europe-s-oldest-art-1.15805">whether Neanderthals made it at all</a>. The symbols made by <em>H. sapiens</em> are clearly more advanced. We had also been around for 100,000 years before symbolic objects appeared so what happened?</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="We had the capacity for art early in our history (Credit: SPL)" data-caption="We had the capacity for art early in our history (Credit: SPL)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="We had the capacity for art early in our history (Credit: SPL)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2w/d2/p02wd29p.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of We had the capacity for art early in our history (Credit: SPL) </a></div></p><p>Somehow, our language-learning abilities were gradually &quot;switched on&quot;, Tattersall argues. In the same way that early birds developed feathers before they could fly, we had the mental tools for complex language before we developed it.</p><p>We started with language-like symbols as a way to represent the world around us, he says. For example, before you say a word, your brain first has to have a symbolic representation of what it means. These mental symbols eventually led to language in all its complexity and the ability to process information is the main reason we are the only hominin still alive, Tattersall argues.</p><p>It&apos;s not clear exactly when speech evolved, or how. But it seems likely that it was partly driven by another uniquely human trait: our superior social skills.</p><blockquote><p> While both chimps and humans cooperate, we will always help more </p></blockquote><p>Comparative studies between humans and chimps show that while both will cooperate, humans will always help more. <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150407-are-you-nicer-than-a-child">Children seem to be innate helpers</a>. They act selflessly before social norms set in. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cdep.12101">Studies have shown</a> that they will spontaneously open doors for adults and pick up &quot;accidentally&quot; dropped items. They will even stop playing to help. Their sense of fairness begins young. Even if an experiment is unfairly rigged so that one child receives more rewards, they will ensure a reward is fairly split. </p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="Children show &apos;proactive&apos; kindness, unlike our close relatives (Credit: Thinkstock)" data-caption="Children show &apos;proactive&apos; kindness, unlike our close relatives (Credit: Thinkstock)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="Children show &apos;proactive&apos; kindness, unlike our close relatives (Credit: Thinkstock)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2w/d2/p02wd2vw.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of Children show &apos;proactive&apos; kindness, unlike our close relatives (Credit: Thinkstock) </a></div></p><p>We know that chimpanzees also work together and share food in apparently unselfish ways. However, <a href="http://wwwstaff.eva.mpg.de/~tomas/">Michael Tomasello</a> of the Max Planck institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, says they will <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.08.066">only cooperate if there is something in it for them</a>.</p><p>&quot;Humans do that too, but in addition they care about what their partner gets. In some experiments we have children as young as 14-18 months who seem to expect their partner to collaborate in certain ways and who share in ways chimps don&apos;t.&quot;</p><p>Human children are less selective about who they share with. Chimpanzees though, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.02.014">largely only share</a> with close relatives, reciprocating partners or potential mates.</p><p><a href="https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/lds/research/warneken/warneken/">Felix Warneken</a> of Harvard University in Cambridge, US, differentiates it like this. Children are &quot;proactive&quot;, that is, they help even when presented with only very subtle cues. Chimpanzees though, need more encouragement. They are &quot;reactive&quot;: they will hand over objects but only after some nudging.</p><blockquote><p> What happened in our evolution to make us reliant on each other? </p></blockquote><p>Something must have happened in our evolution, Tomasello says, to make humans increasingly reliant on each other. Our brains needed fuel to get bigger and so collaborative hunting may have played a key role in that. Our advanced teamwork may simply reflect our long history of <a href="http://doi:10.1038/nature10278">working together to get food</a>.</p><p><strong>Mind readers</strong></p><p>The fact that our nearest relatives share too simply shows that it is an ancient trait. It was already present in the messy branch of early humans that led to us, but none of these other species were as hyper cooperative as we are today. </p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: Thinkstock)" data-caption="Humans have a unique ability to understand the beliefs of another person (Credit: Thinkstock)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: Thinkstock)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2w/d2/p02wd2dl.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: Thinkstock) </a></div></p><p>These cooperative skills are closely tied to our incredible mind reading skills. We understand what others think based upon our knowledge of the world, but we also understand what others cannot know. The Sally-Anne task is a simple way to test young children&apos;s ability to do this.</p><p>The child witnesses a doll called Sally putting a marble in a basket in full view of another doll, Anne. When Sally leaves the room, Anne moves the marble to a box. Sally then comes back, and the experimenter asks the child where Sally will look for the marble.</p><blockquote><p> Chimpanzees know what others know and what others can see, but not what others believe </p></blockquote><p>Because Sally didn&apos;t see Anne move the marble, she will have a &quot;false belief&quot; that the marble is still in the basket. Most 4-year-olds can grasp this, and say that Sally will look in the basket. They know the marble is not there, but they also understand that Sally is missing the key bit of information. <strong><br> </strong><br> <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131125-can-this-sneaky-chimp-read-minds">Chimps can knowingly deceive others</a>, so they understand the world view of others to some extent. However, they cannot understand others&apos; false beliefs. In a chimpanzee version of the Sally-Anne task, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/doi:10.1006/anbe.2000.1518">researchers found</a> that they understand when a competitor is ignorant of the location of food, but not when they have been misinformed. <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2008.08.010">Tomasello puts it like this</a>: chimpanzees know what others know <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131125-can-this-sneaky-chimp-read-minds">and what others can see</a>, but not what others believe. </p><blockquote><p> We are unique in the level of abstractness with which we can reason about others&apos; mental states </p></blockquote><p>This tells us something profound about ourselves.

We may see evidence of basic linguistic abilities in chimpanzees, but we are the only ones writing things down.</p><p>We tell stories, we dream, we imagine things about ourselves and others and we spend a great deal of time thinking about the future and analysing the past.</p><blockquote><p> We have a fundamental urge to link our minds together </p></blockquote><p>There&apos;s more to it, <a href="https://www.psy.uq.edu.au/directory/index.html?id=39">Thomas Suddendorf</a>, an evolutionary psychologist at the University of Queensland in Australia is keen to point out. We have a fundamental urge to link our minds together. &quot;This allows us to take advantage of others&apos; experiences, reflections and imaginings to prudently guide our own behaviour.</p><p>&quot;We link our scenario-building minds into larger networks of knowledge.&quot; This in turn helps us to accumulate information through many generations.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="We connect up our brains, and it&apos;s one of our defining traits (Credit: SPL)" data-caption="We connect up our brains, and it&apos;s one of our defining traits (Credit: SPL)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="We connect up our brains, and it&apos;s one of our defining traits (Credit: SPL)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2w/d2/p02wd2c0.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of We connect up our brains, and it&apos;s one of our defining traits (Credit: SPL) </a></div></p><p>That our rapidly expanding technology has allowed us all to become instant publishers means we can share such information at the touch of a button. And this transmission of ideas and technology helps us in our quest to uncover even more about ourselves. That is, we use language to continue ideas that others put forward.</p><p>Of course, we pass on the good and the bad. The technology that defines us can also destroy worlds.</p><p>Take murder.

This still stands true but Suddendorf says that it is precisely these gradual changes that make us extraordinary and has led to &quot;radically different possibilities of thinking&quot;.</p><p>And it is these thoughts that allow us to pinpoint to our differences with chimpanzees. That we do so is because they are the closest living relative we have. If any of the now extinct early humans were still alive, we would be comparing our behaviour to them instead.</p><p>Still, as far as we know, we are the only creatures trying to understand where we came from. We also peer further back in time, and further into the future, than any other animal. What other species would think to ponder the age of the universe, or how it will end?&quot;</p><p>We have an immense capacity for good. At the same time we risk driving our closest relatives to extinction and destroying the only planet we have ever called home.</p><p><em>This is part of a two-part feature series looking at whether humans are really unique.
