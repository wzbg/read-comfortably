It&rsquo;s particularly crucial to our understanding of AI because in the future we may be surrounded by machines that are indistinguishable from ourselves &ndash; and we need to know how we will react.</p><p>&ldquo;Most of the time we encounter AI today, it&rsquo;s in a very mechanical interface,&rdquo; says Kevin Corti, one of the researchers. His answer was to use a human body, with a robot mind. &ldquo;This was a way of doing it so that people actually believe they are encountering another person.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02xbrcb\"}}</p><p>Corti and his supervisor Alex Gillespie were inspired by work on &ldquo;cyranoids&rdquo; &ndash; an experiment invented by the controversial psychologist Stanley Milgram. He is most famous for his notorious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment\">experiment on obedience</a> &ndash; in which he asked subjects to inflict electric shocks, of increasing voltage, on another person. Even when it looked like the shocks were becoming dangerously painful, many continued &ndash; apparently showing how easily we will harm another rather than question authority.</p><p>By the end of his life, however, Milgram seems to have turned his mind to the gentler subject of body perception. When we are talking to someone, do we really listen to what they are saying? Or are our opinions pre-formed, <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150707-is-faceism-spoiling-your-life\">based solely on what a person looks like</a>?</p><p>To find out, he took a leaf out of a 19th Century play, Cyrano de Bergerac. De Bergerac is an accomplished soldier, a witty poet, and a skilled musician, but he considers himself too ugly to woo his pretty cousin Roxane. So instead, he offers to help his handsome-but-dim rival Christian win her hand instead, by telling him exactly what to say. In the most famous scene of the play, Cyrano hides in the bushes, quietly prompting Christian with sweet nothings, who then repeats them to Roxane, who is standing on her balcony.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02xbrn2\"}}</p><p>A similar set-up, Milgram realised, would be the perfect way of testing how much our body shapes perceptions our mind. So he set up experiments in which a &ldquo;cyranoid&rdquo; is fed words from another person in another room, through a small radio transmitter in the ear. Like Roxane in the play, the other people they encounter are not told of the strange set-up.</p><blockquote><p> The fact that everything the other person said originated in the mind of a distal source simple didn&rsquo;t enter the picture </p></blockquote><p>Milgram was amazed to discover that most people have lengthy, 20-minute conversations with the cyranoid without noticing that anything was amiss. &ldquo;The fact that everything the other person said originated in the mind of a distal source&hellip; simply doesn't enter into the picture,&rdquo; he wrote. He then started to push the set-up further and further, seeing, for example, what happens when an aged professor controlled a young child, for instance.</p><p>Milgram died in 1984, before he&rsquo;d finished his enquiries, and his cyranoid experiments remained forgotten for two decades before Gillespie decided to revisit the idea. One of his first attempts replicated one of Milgram&rsquo;s experiments with a child cyranoid. In this case, Gillespie fed lines to an 11-year-old boy, being interviewed by a panel of adults. Their capacity to patronise was astonishing. &ldquo;I was questioned about graphene, Henry James, the death of Margaret Thatcher, the financial crisis and they go, well, that boy&rsquo;s pretty clever, he&rsquo;s probably got a mental age of 15,&rdquo; remembers Gillespie.</p><p><strong>Living zombies</strong></p><p>The philosophical point is that people are really bad at judging if someone is acting of their own free will, or if they are a &ldquo;zombie&rdquo; acting another&rsquo;s commands. &ldquo;No matter how big the incongruity between body and mind, people won&rsquo;t notice,&rdquo; says Corti. Or, put another way &ndash; we go by appearances more than judging the substance of someone&rsquo;s thoughts.</p><p>It&rsquo;s easy to be sceptical, but I too was taken in when I visited the team&rsquo;s labs and Gillespie introduced me to Corti. The young woman in front of me certainly didn&rsquo;t look like the pictures I&rsquo;d seen of Kevin, I thought. I told myself that maybe Kevin was transgender. In fact, Kevin was in another room, and I was talking to Sophia (who, in real life, is a student at LSE and has conducted her own experiments using the same set-up). To me, it showed how easy it is to fall for the trick even when you might be expecting it. Clearly, knowledge of the cyranoid illusion isn&rsquo;t enough to break its spell.</p><blockquote><p> We can put the machine mind in a human body, to see what happens </p></blockquote><p>With these successes, Corti and Gillespie began to think of further extremes to test, and that was when they had their &lsquo;aha moment&rsquo;, he says. &ldquo;We thought, can we push it further so you don&rsquo;t even need a person to generate the words.&rdquo; The result is an &ldquo;echoborg&rdquo; &ndash; a new breed of cyranoid in which a person relays the words of a chatbot, rather than a real person.</p><p>In this way, Corti hoped to catch a glimpse of the future, when robots are more realistic. &ldquo;We are very long way away from a perfectly human interface, but we can leapfrog that and put the machine mind in a human body, to see what happens.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02xbs8k\"}}</p><p>In one set-up, the participants were completely naive &ndash; they had not been told they might be speaking to a robot. As Milgram might have predicted, they were still clueless, even after lengthy conversations. &ldquo;The vast majority of participants never picked up that they were speaking to the words of the computer program. They just assumed the person had some problem, where there social inhibitions had been diminished. Never for a minute did they think they were talking to a hybrid,&rdquo; says Corti.</p><p>Science fiction &ndash; <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_%28TV_series%29\">including the recent TV series Humans</a> &ndash; has long questioned whether robots could one day integrate in our society, to the point we no longer make a distinction between who is alive and who is electronic; Corti&rsquo;s experiments suggest that even with today&rsquo;s limited AI, we are already more easily fooled than you would imagine.</p><p>There&rsquo;s a catch, however. The team later tried to replicate the classic &ldquo;Turing Test&rdquo; of artificial intelligence. So in another condition, the participants were told that they may or may not be talking to a robot &ndash; and they had to guess which. Surprisingly, in this situation, the chatbot was no more likely to pass the Turing Test than if they had been chatting on a screen. &ldquo;The bar is higher &ndash; people expect more,&rdquo; says Gillespie.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a kind of paradox: without being told that we might be speaking to an AI, we simply assume that our conversation partner lies in the stranger part of the spectrum of human behaviour. But as soon as we know that it might not be human, we are extra critical of its failings. &ldquo;We might have AI&rsquo;s intelligent beyond belief but our knowledge of them being non-human might limit our desire to interact with them in a human way,&rdquo; says Corti.</p><p><strong>Uncanny, or awkward?</strong></p><p>Gillespie is particularly interested in the dilemmas that come with this kind of face-to-face encounter. &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t just walk away if eyes are looking at you,&rdquo; says Gillespie. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an obligation &ndash; and that&rsquo;s why people feel awkward, whereas you would never feel awkward talking to a screen,&rdquo; explains Gillespie.</p><p>I can relate to this. When I visited their labs and spoke to Sophia, she was very good at making the words flow naturally. Consider the following exchange:</p><p>Me: What&rsquo;s in the news today?<br /> Sophia: According to the BBC, the UK will vote on the EU, but not on 5 May.<br /> M: OK. Now, why don&rsquo;t you ask me a question?<br /> S: Who is your favourite band?<br /> M: I&rsquo;m not really into bands but I do like songwriters like Joni Mitchell.<br /> S: Joni Mitchell, sure, I like her a lot. She often stops by to say hello.</p><p>In fact, had we been talking online, I would have been fooled (though I might have assumed she was a confabulator). But face-to-face with her strange answers, any pause or hiccup became excruciating &ndash; in a way I wouldn&rsquo;t have experienced, had we been chatting over instant messenger.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02xbqmb\"}}</p><p>For this reason, Gillespie thinks talking robots may face a problem akin to the &ldquo;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley\">uncanny valley</a>&rdquo; effect. The more realistic computer animations of humans become, the more uncanny they appear &ndash; a phenomenon seen in some CGI films. When you add conversation into the picture, it becomes even more unsettling. &ldquo;As artificial intelligence starts to get close to pass for human, it&rsquo;s not just uncanny, it&rsquo;s awkward. There&rsquo;s a kind of awkward valley,&rdquo; he says. It&rsquo;s a strange thought that our primary emotion in the face of future robots won&rsquo;t be the terror that science fiction predicts &ndash; but embarrassment.</p><p>Overcoming that kind of issue will be crucial if AI is to become part of our lives, which is why Corti and Gillespie are keen to continue the echoborg experiments. &ldquo;I think it really gets us ahead of the curve,&rdquo; says Gillespie. &ldquo;If you look at history, we think it&rsquo;s powered by technology &ndash; but it&rsquo;s not. It&rsquo;s public opinion. They will decide if these things are on the streets as police officers, so a huge amount of work needs to be done to see how we relate to it.&rdquo;</p><p>At their heart, these experiments may even question what means to be alive. Just consider if there really was a robot that looked like Sophia the echoborg, but without the stilted conversation of the chatbot. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is there something more to us than our behaviour?&rdquo; asks Corti. &ldquo;Because if a machine can mimic physical and behavioural dimensions of us, then why wouldn&rsquo;t we call that human?&rdquo;</p><p><em>Follow us</em> <em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em><strong>Google+</strong></em></a> and <strong><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><em>LinkedIn</em></a></strong></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[{"Content":{"FileSizeBytes":0,"MimeType":"unknown","SourceHeight":0,"SourceUrl":"http://deltaorigin.bbc.co.uk/images/live/p0/0q/8t/p00q8tbz.jpg","SourceWidth":0,"SynopsisLong":"In Depth","SynopsisMedium":"In Depth","SynopsisShort":"In Depth","TemplateUrl":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/$recipe/images/live/p0/0q/8t/p00q8tbz.jpg","Title":"inDepth.jpg","CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p00q8tbz","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p00q8tbz","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:image:p00q8tbz","_id":"55e3c53a983c37e31d45d209"}],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Take a deep dive into the big stories in science, technology and health written by some of the best writers around.","Name":"In Depth","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"In Depth","CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"2f2913c9-bea2-4db6-bb48-d5d2e0871b8d","Id":"wwfuture/column/in-depth","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-05-20T10:55:47.308249Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/in-depth"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/in-depth","_id":"55dc5713983c37e31d2fd9ad"},{"Content":{"AssetImage":[{"Content":{"FileSizeBytes":169058,"MimeType":"image/jpeg","SourceHeight":1080,"SourceUrl":"http://deltaorigin.bbc.co.uk/images/live/p0/2w/zh/p02wzhd0.jpg","SourceWidth":1920,"SynopsisLong":"(Credit: Alamy)","SynopsisMedium":"(Credit: Alamy)","SynopsisShort":"(Credit: Alamy)","TemplateUrl":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/$recipe/images/live/p0/2w/zh/p02wzhd0.jpg","Title":"AI_landing_page_banner_Alamy_1920x1080.jpg"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p02wzhd0","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:image:p02wzhd0","_id":"55dc5812983c37e31d309ca0"}],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"AI: The Ultimate Guide","Name":"AI: The Ultimate Guide","Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Title":"AI: The Ultimate Guide"},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-07-13T14:09:08.994206Z","Entity":"collection","Guid":"4c9ffd09-6cf6-47d0-9beb-810120cababa","Id":"wwfuture/column/ai-the-ultimate-guide","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-07-22T12:11:56.411596Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"column/ai-the-ultimate-guide"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:collection:wwfuture/column/ai-the-ultimate-guide","_id":"55dc5712983c37e31d2fd900"}],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-07-20T15:28:54Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The people ‘possessed’ by computers","HeadlineShort":"The people ‘possessed’ by computers","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"What would happen if a computer could take over a human body?

For me, the answer is not pleasant.</p><p>I&rsquo;m about four years old, and I&rsquo;m sitting in the green-carpeted hallway of our family&rsquo;s first home in Biloxi, Mississippi. The bathroom door stands open in front of me, and my mother is emerging from the shower. As she pulls a towel from the rack, I notice a dark stain marring that clean, fluffy pink material. It&rsquo;s a cockroach. I see it before she does. As she wraps the towel around her body, however, it quickly makes itself known. She shrieks, flailing and stomping, suddenly naked and vulnerable and afraid. I begin to cry.</p><p>I recently asked my mother about this event, and she had no idea what I was talking about. Perhaps I dreamed it, or my early memory is flawed. Or perhaps it was just business-as-usual in our Southern US home, where &ndash; no matter what chemical barriers were erected &ndash; cockroaches inevitably found their way inside.</p><p>Real or imaginary, this incident triggered an intense dislike of cockroaches that would only intensify as years passed and encounters with those creatures multiplied. For me, a roach is not just an insect. It is a psychological gateway into a lengthy laundry list of traumatic experiences: digging through a box of supplies in my outdoor playhouse when a roach zips out and scuttles up my leg, its spiky appendages pricking at my skin. Watching my first cat, Salty, as he traps a roach, dismembers it with his claws and mouth, and then eats the succulent, writhing remains. Finding a small dead cockroach tangled in my wet hair after a trip to the beach, and thereafter suffering recurring nightmares of picking roaches out of my hair.</p><p>Roaches invade our homes and make those intimate spaces their own. As physical embodiments of filth and germs, they show that for all of our fortifications against dirt and disease, those efforts are ultimately futile. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve really figured out how to exploit the opportunities we create, and in doing so, developed behaviours and life histories that prevent us from controlling them,&rdquo; says Jeff Lockwood, a professor of natural sciences and humanities at the University of Wyoming. &ldquo;In a sense, we loathe that which we foster.&rdquo; Our very existence enables them to thrive.</p><p>The true nature of that relationship &ndash; and the irrational fear it so often inspires &ndash; was something I was compelled to learn more about for very personal reasons. That mission would require me to dig out the cockroach exoskeletons in my closet, explore intriguing new techniques to help us conquer insect fear, and ultimately confront the terror head-on, by journeying into the heart of six-legged darkness, at one of the premier cockroach labs in the world. Along the way, however, I would uncover an unsettling truth about the future of our relationship with roaches, and it would transform the way I see these life-long foes.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xptg\"}}</p><p>Delving into cockroach lore, I quickly learned that our distaste for them goes way back. The <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/25/magazine/25PHENOM.html\">ancient Egyptians fashioned spells</a> imploring the ram-headed god Khnum to banish cockroaches; in ancient Rome, <a href=\"http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/HistSciTech/HistSciTech-idx?type=turn&amp;id=HistSciTech.Nature18701110&amp;entity=HistSciTech.Nature18701110.p0007&amp;isize=text\">Pliny the Elder wrote</a> of the &ldquo;disgusting&rdquo; nature of those pests; and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH5KAhdU2iQ\">John Smith of Jamestown complained</a> of the &ldquo;ill-scented dung&rdquo; of the &ldquo;cacarooch&rdquo;, which quickly took up residence throughout the New World. By the 19th Century, the handful of cockroach species that carved out a niche for themselves as pests had more or less achieved global domination.</p><p>Yet given what we know today, logically it does not make sense to fear cockroaches. Unlike mosquitoes, ticks or fleas, roaches aren&rsquo;t disease vectors, and they do not feed directly on our blood, skin or fluids. We don&rsquo;t go screaming when we see a mosquito, even though they are the <a href=\"http://www.gatesnotes.com/Health/Most-Lethal-Animal-Mosquito-Week\">world&rsquo;s deadliest animal</a>. Yes, cockroaches wallow in filth, but a case of food poisoning is probably about as bad as it gets if one of those pests skitters across your slice of pizza &ndash; a stroll through the park compared to malaria, yellow fever or dengue fever.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xplc\"}}</p><p>Still, anecdotally, many people suffer from katsaridaphobia, or cockroach phobia. Lockwood guesses that the number reaches well into the tens of millions, and Richard Kaae, an entomologist at California State University, thinks that cockroaches are the number one insects feared by humans. Quantifying the impacts of katsaridaphobia is difficult, however. The vast majority of people incapacitated by roaches never seek help, primarily because they want to do everything possible to avoid even speaking of those creatures. I was one of them &ndash; until I decided to do something about it.</p><p><strong><em>They creep up on you</em></strong><em><br /> I had been busy all afternoon in my New Orleans kitchen, preparing dinner for a guy I liked. After the meal, we headed outside to enjoy the magnolia-perfumed breeze drifting off the Mississippi. As I coyly sipped my wine </em>&ndash; <em>SMACK! </em>&ndash; <em>a flying cockroach touched down straight on my cheek. Releasing a staccato scream, I spasmodically jerked my arms upward and sent a waterfall of red wine down my date&rsquo;s face and white shirt. He stood there, stunned. That roach ruined my date.&nbsp; <br /> </em><br /> In the worst cases, roaches actively impact the victim&rsquo;s life. Psychologists report patients too terrified to get out of bed at night or to go to the kitchen for fear of encountering a cockroach. Emily Driscoll, a documentary producer in New York City, once became trapped in a hotel room in India because a roach was sitting on the door handle. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t move, I was paralysed,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;I needed to keep in it my sight.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026yvc8\"}}</p><p>Andrew Stein, a computer programmer who grew up in New Orleans but now lives in New York, also recalls once being trapped by a roach. One night in his newly renovated Brooklyn apartment, he heard a familiar scratch-scratch-scratch coming from the bathroom. &ldquo;This was not a place I was expecting to see a bunch of insects,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I thought, &lsquo;That sounds like it could be a cockroach.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Investigating, he found a large American cockroach clinging to his bath towel. He spent the next two hours camped out in the hallway, trying to work up the courage to go back inside and kill the roach. When his roommate came home at around 2am, however, Stein saw a better way out: he paid his roommate $10 to dispose of the roach rather than face it himself. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s probably the most emasculating thing I&rsquo;ve ever told anyone,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p><p>It&rsquo;s hard to pinpoint what exactly it is about cockroaches that bothers people so much, simply because there are so many answers. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re erratic; it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;re doing eight things at once; they look dirty; they move really fast; they seem to have no fear of people,&rdquo; Stein rattles off. &ldquo;The first thing I think about when I see one is that that thing could jump across the room and touch me if it wanted to &ndash; and there&rsquo;s nothing I could do about it.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq07\"}}</p><p>As Lockwood explains, the things we find so repulsive about roaches are all a matter of those creatures&rsquo; biology. &ldquo;Cockroaches tap into this sort of evolutionary aversion we have to greasy, smelly, slimy things,&rdquo; he says. Their unpredictable movements and phenomenal speed &ndash; relative to their size, they&rsquo;re one of the fastest terrestrial animals on Earth &ndash; evolved as escape mechanisms for evading predators. Their stench, too, is indicative of an underlying purpose. The reason why smashed cockroaches smell like a clogged truck stop toilet that&rsquo;s been fermenting in 90-degree heat is because they store nitrogenous waste &ndash; uric acid, specifically &ndash; in their fat for recycling. Finally, their sickly slick feel derives from a lipid-based wax that their cuticle secretes to prevent water loss. None of these traits bode well for the human observer.</p><p>&ldquo;Plus,&rdquo; Lockwood adds, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re defiant little bastards.&rdquo;</p><p>Roaches are incredibly prolific, and hard to get rid of. If you start out with one pair of German cockroaches and allow them to reproduce in peace and with bountiful food available, then &ldquo;within a couple years you could have two to three million&rdquo;, Kaae says. They&rsquo;ll also eat just about anything, from cork to paper to grass. In the heaviest of infestations &ndash; on Navy submarines and in children&rsquo;s bedrooms alike &ndash; they will gnaw off their sleeping victims&rsquo; eyelashes.&nbsp;</p><p>But those physical and behavioural traits do not explain why roaches are so frequently the subjects of phobias. As it turns out, the root of that fear often traces back to some traumatic experience in life, such as witnessing your mother scream at the sight of a roach. Often, that fear forms early, around the age of four or five. &ldquo;Evolutionarily, we&rsquo;re highly attuned to picking up on cultural clues from parents and society as to how we ought to respond to insects,&rdquo; Lockwood says. &ldquo;Today, most of that feedback is negative so we wind up raising anxious children.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq4f\"}}</p><p>Some do manage to evade that fear, however. Philip Koehler, a veteran entomologist with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, probably spends more time (voluntarily) with cockroaches than almost anyone else in the world. At his lab at the University of Florida, he keeps around a million of those insects. Although intimately familiar with the roach antics that bother so many people, he&rsquo;s nonplussed. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t overcome any fear because I never had any fear,&rdquo; he says, chuckling. &ldquo;I was probably a twisted individual right from start.&rdquo;</p><p>His fascination with those creatures does have its limits, however. &ldquo;Personally, I don&rsquo;t find them to be attractive,&rdquo; he admits.</p><p>On a warm spring morning I dropped by Koehler&rsquo;s office with a two-fold mission: glean all I can about his pesky research subjects and, more importantly, confront them one-on-one.</p><p>The clutter of Koehler&rsquo;s office reflects a nearly 40-year career; the walls and shelves are crowded with gag gifts and posters professing his comical hatred, not of roaches, but of cats; faded, poster-sized prints of the horrendous cockroach infestations of the 80s; and a wall full of awards. Outside, a disturbingly realistic 6-foot tall metal cockroach sculpture, lovingly crafted by one of his former students, guards his door. Earlier, one of Koehler&rsquo;s students warned me that &ldquo;Dr Koehler loves to make people feel strange&rdquo;, and I half expect some sort of trickery &ndash; a roach in my coffee, an insect tossed my way, but luckily we start slow. The trust is not broken. He&rsquo;s here to help. &nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0274219\"}}</p><p>Koehler is no psychologist, but he&rsquo;s familiar with treatments for cockroach phobias. Several years ago, a woman in her 50s approached him. She said her life was completely disrupted by cockroaches; everywhere she went, she couldn&rsquo;t function because she was always on the lookout for a cockroach. Was there anything he could do to help? He invited her to the lab for an informal session of exposure therapy, starting small by simply talking about roaches, then progressing to photos, pinned roaches and eventually the real deal. After several visits, her hyperventilating stopped and she was even able to hold a hissing cockroach. I&rsquo;ve travelled to Gainesville to see if the same treatment could work for me.</p><p>He begins by weeding out my issue with roaches. &ldquo;What is it you don&rsquo;t like about them?&rdquo; he asks, peering inquisitively from behind wire-framed glasses. &ldquo;The colour, the movement, maybe the feel of their legs?&rdquo;</p><p>I relay a few of my stories, trying to make him understand, and he listens patiently until I finish. &ldquo;So the roaches never really hurt you?&rdquo; he asks, leaning forward over the desk. He&rsquo;s challenging the logic of my fear &ndash; a tried and true tactic when it comes to treating irrational phobias.</p><p>&ldquo;Well, no, I guess not,&rdquo; I admit. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s just they were there&hellip; They were in my space&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>&ldquo;They just startled you,&rdquo; he suggests.</p><p>&ldquo;Yeah, I guess it must be something about the surprise&hellip;&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xqbl\"}}</p><p>He&rsquo;s technically right, but I don&rsquo;t feel fully satisfied with the conclusion we&rsquo;ve reached. &ldquo;Startled&rdquo; doesn&rsquo;t begin to articulate what roaches manage to do to me. Later, I realise how I should have conveyed the problem. When a roach slinks into my bedroom at night or flies into my face, I am forced to acknowledge that all is not under my control. Just as a leering cat-caller or subway groper might not inflict physical harm on his victims, that undesirable interaction can still inspire intense distress. Unprovoked danger &ndash; whether actual or perceived &ndash; can appear without warning. It can slink out of a dark alleyway or from beneath a closet door at any moment.</p><p>To their victims, cockroaches commit a personal violation. In the words of George A. Romero, <a href=\"http://vimeo.com/53490236\">they creep up on you</a>. And there&rsquo;s nothing you can do to stop them.</p><p>Yet could there be a way to conquer that aversion?</p><p><strong><em>Exposure therapy</em> </strong><br /> <em>&ldquo;Hey, Roach!&rdquo; a third-grade classmate jeered at me one day. Cleverly, he had replaced my nickname, &ldquo;Rach&rdquo;, with that of my nemesis. But rather than being offended, I fully embraced the new moniker, drawing cartoon roaches on folded notes passed under desks to friends, encouraging the nickname&rsquo;s use. Roaches are cute, I told myself, even lovable. There&rsquo;s nothing to be afraid of. But when a living roach would appear in the school bathroom or gym, these soothing thoughts were revealed for what they really were: lies told to comfort a scared little girl. <br /> </em><br /> Over the years, I noticed my phobia intensifying. Viewing this as a weakness, I tried in my own ways to self medicate. In high school, I stayed up late playing &ldquo;Bad Mojo,&rdquo; a computer game about a criminal entomologist who is transformed into a cockroach, and encouraged slumber party karaoke of &ldquo;Joe&rsquo;s Apartment&rdquo; cockroach <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ru_EiJgTodQ\">song renditions</a>. But digitised, anthropomorphised roaches on a two-dimensional screen and real-life roaches are not at all the same beast.</p><p>A bit older and living in New Orleans, I volunteered to work at the Audubon Zoo&rsquo;s hands-on Discovery Walk, and requested to work with the Madagascar hissing cockroaches and giant Brazilian cockroaches. Perhaps if I demonstrated roaches&rsquo; harmlessness to children, I thought, I could somehow undo my own distaste for them. But even though I regularly handled those exotic species, I still performed a sort of panicked Riverdance each time one of their urban cousins crossed my path in the infested Crescent City.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq1z\"}}</p><p>I find it hard to believe that anything could ever change my feelings and reaction towards roaches. But not everyone agrees with this hopeless prognosis.</p><p>Defeating phobias, therapists insist, just requires becoming habituated to the cause of that fear, whether it&rsquo;s cockroaches, heights or being in crowds. Expose someone to the same thing over and over again and it will eventually become boring and commonplace. Untold numbers of phobics go untreated, however, simply because few possess the unique mix of desperation and bravery needed to willingly sign up for the chance to interact with a cockroach. &ldquo;The idea of touching a roach is pretty much the worst thing I can think of,&rdquo; Stein says.</p><p>Some therapists are designing workarounds for skittish patients. A team of researchers at the James I University in Spain <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20569788\">thinks that augmented reality</a> could be a solution for treating cockroach phobia. Augmented reality projects computerised images into the real world, allowing a more convincing encounter. To apply this for cockroach phobia treatments, a headset combined with a six degrees of freedom tracking system creates a vision of cockroaches running over the wearer&rsquo;s actual hand.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xpxm\"}}</p><p>To test the system, the Spanish researchers recruited six participants, all of who suffered from debilitating, clinically verified cockroach phobias. One participant wanted to sell her apartment after spotting a roach, while another refused to visit her grandmother for fear of seeing a cockroach. Still others reported &ldquo;complete loss of control&rdquo; when seeing a cockroach.</p><p>Before undergoing augmented reality therapy, none of the women would agree to enter a room that contained a live cockroach in a plastic container. After putting on the augmented reality headset and watching fantasy roaches crawl all over their hands for one to three hours, however, the women&rsquo;s anxiety levels slowly began to decline. When the treatment session concluded, they were able to approach the live cockroach and even stick a finger into its container for a few seconds. Twelve months after the original treatment, the participants maintained those improvements.</p><p>&ldquo;A phobic brain has stored bad information about cockroaches: it thinks cockroaches are very, very dangerous,&rdquo; says Cristina Botella, a professor of clinical psychology and leader of the study. The augmented reality system, however, changes that fear structure by demonstrating cockroaches&rsquo; harmlessness. &ldquo;The brain is able to store new information that is not compatible with the old,&rdquo; she says. &nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, augmented reality is not yet available in a clinical setting. Until further research can be completed and the treatment gains approval for use in therapy, phobics wishing to rid themselves of their fear must go about it in the old fashioned way: through cognitive behaviour therapy paired with exposure therapy.</p><p>For those who can garner the courage to try it, their efforts are often rewarded in as few as one to three sessions. &ldquo;These therapies provide a way to live with those creatures rather than spend a life trying to avoid them,&rdquo; Lockwood says. &nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq36\"}}</p><p>Back in Gainesville, I&rsquo;m hoping this kind of therapy might work for me. We leave Koehler&rsquo;s office, heading to a closed door just down the hall. &ldquo;And here we have our cockroach room!&rdquo; he proclaims, swinging open the portal to my personal hell. I want to wait a moment to gather my resolve, but he shoos me in. Suddenly, I am surrounded by at least a million roaches of 14 different species. They are on display no more than four feet in front of me, in dozens of glass jars fitted with deceptively festive orange and blue lids. Each contains a teeming mass of insects, from bitty babies smaller than my pinky nail to giant Brazilian cockroaches larger than a mouse. My gaze, however, immediately seeks out and settles on that most reviled species of all: the American cockroach.</p><p>There they sit, about a dozen of them: bloated, shining, and the colour of slick sewage, the glass of their enclosure stained with faeces and regurgitate. Their antennae waggle as they slowly mull about the confines of their glass enclosure. I can hear them; the gentle scratch, scratch, scratch of their spiny feet. As Koehler and Liz Pereira, the lab&rsquo;s official &ldquo;roach rearer,&rdquo; parade various specimens before me &ndash; the comical Madagascar hissing roaches, pullers of toy tractors; the Suriname cockroach, which burrows into its substrate like an earthworm; a colony of German cockroaches named after the Chinese restaurant they were collected from; the Cuban cockroach, a striking chartreuse creature with delicate wings, the only lovable one of the bunch, but sadly discovered to have died sometime over the past day &ndash; my peripheral vision never leaves those American cockroaches. I can feel it in the hairs on my arms, in the racy beat of my heart and slight shortness of breath.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026ywc4\"}}</p><p>Finally, the moment to confront those monsters has arrived. Pereira pulls the American cockroaches off their place on the shelf and gently deposits them on the counter before me. I take an instinctive step back, putting Koehler&rsquo;s body between the roaches and myself, subconsciously seeking out a protective parental presence as that timeless fear resurfaces. Pereira, meanwhile, is all giggles. &ldquo;On my first day here I reacted like you,&rdquo; she says, grinning. Then, she moves to remove the lid.</p><p>&ldquo;Wait! Won&rsquo;t they fly out?&rdquo; I protest &ndash; but it&rsquo;s already done.</p><p>The reek of their existence fills the small room, and I crinkle my nose while craning my neck toward the jar. Nestled within protective folds of cardboard, several large roaches wave back to me with their antennae.</p><p>I swallow, and then ask, &ldquo;Is it possible to touch one?&rdquo; Koehler grins. &ldquo;Of course it is!&rdquo;</p><p>In one swift motion, Pereira snatches the cardboard shelter from the jar, seamlessly transferring it to another empty container and banging it against the walls. The roaches tumble forth from their hideout, scattering around the glass enclosure in startled confusion. She uses carbon dioxide to sedate them (I&rsquo;m curious but not crazy). Eventually, they all grow still.</p><p>Pereira reaches in and scoops one up. &ldquo;Want to hold it?&rdquo; she asks.</p><p>I extend a trembling hand, and she drops a fat specimen it into my open palm. My brain struggles to register this conflicting information &ndash; I am holding a cockroach, and it&rsquo;s fine &ndash; and I laugh nervously, slightly hysterically even, as Koehler snaps a few photos. And then it&rsquo;s over. Pereira gently takes the roach and returns it to its slumbering friends.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq51\"}}</p><p>Later, I send a photo of myself holding the roach to my boyfriend. &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t count if you&rsquo;re wearing a glove!&rdquo; he texts back. He clearly doesn&rsquo;t understand, I think, shaking my head. Only a fellow phobic would understand. Glove or no glove, I held a cockroach, and I survived.</p><p>Plus, what we&rsquo;ve discovered about roaches recently suggests that, if we value our health, it&rsquo;s wise to avoid physical contact.</p><p><strong><em>Cause for alarm</em></strong><br /> <em>One early morning during my teenage years, I groggily got out of bed and reached for a box of cookie leftovers on my bedroom floor. I took a big bite, and &ndash; while chewing &ndash; casually noticed a large chunk of chocolate icing was still in the box. Except it wasn&rsquo;t icing. It was a tremendous American cockroach. A roach that had, for all I know, dredged itself in raw sewage and rotting meat, not to mention toting along its own natural garden of microbial terror. I spewed out my mouthful, splattering my white and pink flower-patterned wallpaper with dark streaks of chocolate-infused spittle. Those stains never did come out.</em> <em><br /> </em><br /> There was a reason I wore that glove in Koehler&rsquo;s roach room. People have long suspected that cockroaches are mechanical transmitters of disease &ndash; they walk through rot and faeces and filth and then deposit those germs onto other surfaces. But it&rsquo;s hard to prove that a cockroach is to blame for a case of food poisoning when it could be a chef&rsquo;s dirty hands or any number of other factors that introduced the contamination. Several years ago, however, Koehler and one of his students helped prove that cockroaches could at least <a href=\"http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UFE0006617/00001\">plausibly transmit harmful bacteria</a>. Bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli O157:H7 &ndash; the deadly kind &ndash; can actually swim through the cockroaches&rsquo; waxy outer layers and survive there for at least two months, all the while posing a risk for being transferred to food. Bacteria can also survive a trip through a cockroach gut, so faeces scattered throughout a kitchen or home are like little land mines of potential disease.&nbsp;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xq8c\"}}</p><p>Spreading disease, however, likely is not their biggest impact on our health. Proteins found in cockroach faeces, regurgitates, skin and body parts are potent allergens for many people, as proven when entomologists often become acutely allergic to their research subjects. One famous cockroach expert, William Bell, grew so allergic to the arthropods&rsquo; cuticles that he could no longer eat lobster by the end of his career. Likewise, some people who seem to be allergic to coffee or chocolate are actually just aversely reacting to ground up cockroach parts sprinkled into those products.</p><p>But the worst problems with cockroach allergies occur in urban centres, where there&rsquo;s often no escaping them. People breathe in whiffs of cockroaches on the subway and in restaurants, on the bus and in the street. For many, especially those who live in large apartment buildings with inadequate pest control, their homes are also perfumed with these invisible allergens. If a neighbour isn&rsquo;t taking care of his cockroach problem, then it&rsquo;s almost guaranteed that those allergens will find their way into adjacent apartments, through air vents, shared hallways and pioneering insects travelling through communal walls and plumbing.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xpk4\"}}</p><p>Children are the most impacted victims of cockroach allergies, which have also been associated with asthma attacks. The distribution of asthma is not at all even across New York. In some neighbourhoods, rates soar to 20%.</p><p>In Manhattan&rsquo;s far north, on 168th street, Matt Perzanowski studies these allergens at his lab at Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. He and his colleagues travel to homes across the city and vacuum up dust samples in kitchens and beds. In his white, sterile lab, he analyses the contents of those vials for cockroach parts. From looking, you&rsquo;d never guess that the bodies and refuse of six-legged invaders taint those harmless-looking bits of fuzz and dust. &ldquo;Cockroaches haven&rsquo;t changed,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The critical thing that&rsquo;s changed in terms of exposure is that kids just spent a lot more time inside now, which means they&rsquo;re around cockroaches more.&rdquo;</p><p>There are surely other factors, but Perzanowski has found that kids who live in neighbourhoods with higher rates of asthma are about twice as likely to be allergic to roaches.</p><p>Roaches, in other words, are more than just a source of irrational fear. They may be making us unwell. The question is, what can we do about it?</p><p><strong><em>The coming war</em></strong><br /> <em>I douse the roach in a stream of Raid, taking perverse pleasure in its dance of death. Try as it might, the roach can no longer get a grip on the plaster wall. It topples backward, antennae flailing, wings unfolding, running in frenzied figure-of-eights as if searching for a way out. But it will find no respite from the neurotoxin. Minutes later, it has bucked itself onto its back, its abdomen curled into itself, the closest a roach could come to a foetal position. Life occasionally reasserts itself with a deceptive spasm of the legs, but I know this roach is toast. <br /> </em><br /> Naively, we thought we could stop them. Back in the 1990s, we assumed the war was won when bait traps hit the market. After decades of inefficient home treatments, we had finally developed a method that seemed to completely devastate the enemy. For roaches, baits were &ldquo;like crack-cocaine, the roaches loved them so much&rdquo;, says Jack Brans, owners of Brans Pest Control in Harahan, Louisiana. The hoards were pushed back, the cockroach problem all but eliminated. We humans became complacent. Assuming the problem had been taken care of, fewer entomologists dedicated their studies to roaches, and funding for roach-related research and poisons shifted to other pests, like bedbugs.</p><p>But that success will likely be short-lived. In the early 2000s, a darkness began to re-emerge in kitchens and bathrooms across the country. Whispers of a growing enemy proliferated at entomological conferences across the country. The roaches, experts realised, had begun to fight back. Baits were no longer as effective as they once were.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026xpg7\"}}</p><p>Last year, researchers discovered at least one of the problems: cockroaches have evolved a glucose aversion. The sweetener that roaches originally found irresistible now registers as bitter. With a dearth of researchers available to battle those insects and plenty of regulatory hurdles in the way of developing speedy alternatives, some believe that we&rsquo;re poised on the edge of a coming invasion. &ldquo;Right now, the German cockroach is making this huge comeback,&rdquo; Koehler says. &ldquo;A pest control operator called me just today and said that roaches are running all over the place, that they haven&rsquo;t found anything that will kill them.&rdquo;</p><p>Koehler believes that we will never defeat the roaches. As he points out, those insects were already doing well for themselves for hundreds of millions of years before we showed up. We just gave them the extra boost they needed for global domination. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been able to come up with solutions for almost everything that&rsquo;s been thrown at them for more than 300 million years,&rdquo; he says, a hint of awe in his voice. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way that humans could survive the changes that cockroaches have endured.&rdquo;</p><p>Most likely, they will outlast us, too. When our species finally bites the dust, cockroaches will be there to feast on the rotting remains.</p><p>As I&rsquo;ve come to realise, we need to master our phobias. If not, Koehler warns, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re going to be living in a roach-filled, skittish society&rdquo;.</p><p>As for me, I don&rsquo;t plan on nurturing roach colonies in my apartment anytime soon, and I&rsquo;ll continue to keep a can of Raid under my sink. But when the summer approaches and the roaches creep out of their hiding places, I&rsquo;ve resolved to try to do what many other New Yorkers do: just ignore them. Otherwise, I&rsquo;d be setting myself up for a very distressing future indeed. It&rsquo;s time to get over my fear, and learn to live with our conquerors.<br /> <em><br /> Do you have a cockroach experience you&rsquo;d like to share? </em><em>Let us know on our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a>.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-09-18T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Cockroaches: The insect we're programmed to fear","HeadlineShort":"The bug we’re programmed to fear","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Why are we so revolted by roaches?

It&rsquo;s about the size of a large dog; plump, white and wipe-clean. A belt of bullets &ndash; .50 calibre, the sort that can stop a truck in its tracks &ndash; is draped over one shoulder. An ethernet cable leads from the gun&rsquo;s base and trails through the tidy grass into a small gazebo tent that, in the Korean afternoon heat, you'd be forgiven for hoping might contain plates of cucumber sandwiches and a pot of tea.</p><p>Instead, the cable slithers up onto a trestle table before plunging into the back of a computer, whose screen displays a colourful patchwork of camera feeds. One shows a 180-degree, fish-eye sweep of the horizon in front of us. Another presents a top down satellite view of the scene, like a laid-out Google Map, trained menacingly on our position.</p><p>A red cone, overlaid on the image, indicates the turret&rsquo;s range. It spreads across the landscape: four kilometres-worth of territory, enough distance to penetrate deep into the city from this favourable vantage point. Next to the keyboard sits a complicated joystick, the kind a PC flight simulator enthusiast might use. A laminated sheet is taped to the table in front of the controller, reporting the function of its various buttons. One aims. Another measures the distance from the gun to its target. One loads the bullets into the chamber. Pull the trigger and it will fire.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x4nk5\"}}</p><p>A gaggle of engineers standing around the table flinch as, unannounced, a warning barks out from a massive, tripod-mounted speaker. A targeting square blinks onto the computer screen, zeroing in on a vehicle that&rsquo;s moving in the camera&rsquo;s viewfinder. The gun&rsquo;s muzzle pans as the red square, like something lifted from futuristic military video game Call of Duty, moves across the screen. The speaker, which must accompany the turret on all of its expeditions, is known as an acoustic hailing robot. Its voice has a range of three kilometres. The sound is delivered with unimaginable precision, issuing a warning to a potential target before they are shot (a warning must precede any firing, according to international law, one of the lab-coat wearing engineers tells me). &ldquo;Turn back,&rdquo; it says, in rapid-fire Korean. &ldquo;Turn back or we will shoot.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"South-Korea-Defense-Super-aEgis\"}}</p><p>(Credit: Reuters/YouTube)</p><p>The &ldquo;we&rdquo; is important. The Super aEgis II, South Korea&rsquo;s best-selling automated turret, will not fire without first receiving an OK from a human. The human operator must first enter a password into the computer system to unlock the turret&rsquo;s firing ability. Then they must give the manual input that permits the turret to shoot. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t initially designed this way,&rdquo; explains Jungsuk Park, a senior research engineer for DoDAAM, the turret&rsquo;s manufacturer. Park works in the Robotic Surveillance Division of the company, which is based in the Yuseong tech district of Daejon. It employs 150 staff, most of whom, like Park, are also engineers. &ldquo;Our original version had an auto-firing system,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;But all of our customers asked for safeguards to be implemented. Technologically it wasn&rsquo;t a problem for us. But they were concerned the gun might make a mistake.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> As early as 2005 the New York Times reported the Pentagon&rsquo;s plans to replace soldiers with autonomous robots &nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>The Super aEgis II, first revealed in 2010, is one of a new breed of automated weapon, able to identify, track and destroy a moving target from a great distance, theoretically without human intervention. The machine has proved popular and profitable. DoDAAM claims to have sold more than 30 units since launch, each one as part of integrated defence systems costing more than $40m (&pound;28m) apiece. The turret is currently in active use in numerous locations in the Middle East, including three airbases in the United Arab Emirates (Al Dhafra, Al Safran and Al Minad), the Royal Palace in Abu Dhabi, an armoury in Qatar and numerous other unspecified airports, power plants, pipelines and military airbases elsewhere in the world.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x4q8q\"}}</p><p>The past 15 years has seen a concerted development of such automated weapons and drones. The US military uses similar semi-autonomous robots designed for bomb disposal and surveillance. In 2000, US Congress ordered that one-third of military ground vehicles and deep-strike aircraft should be replaced by robotic vehicles. Six years later, hundreds of PackBot Tactical Mobile Robots were deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan to open doors in urban combat, lay optical fibre, defuse bombs and perform other hazardous duties that would have otherwise been carried out by humans.</p><p><strong>&lsquo;Self-imposed restrictions&rsquo;<br /> </strong></p><p>As early as 2005 the New York Times reported the Pentagon&rsquo;s plans to replace soldiers with autonomous robots. It is easy to understand why. Robots reduce the need for humans in combat and therefore save the lives of soldiers, sailors and pilots. What parent would send their child into a war zone if a robot could do the job instead? But while devices such as the Super aEgis II that are able to kill autonomously have existed for more than a decade, as far as the public knows no fully autonomous gun-carrying robots have been used in active service.</p><p>Science fiction writer Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s First Law of Robotics, that &lsquo;a robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm&rsquo;, looks like it will soon be broken. The call from Human Rights Watch for an outright ban on &ldquo;the development, production, and use of fully autonomous weapons&rdquo; seems preposterously unrealistic. Such machines already exist and are being sold on the market &ndash; albeit with, as DoDAAM&rsquo;s Park put it, &ldquo;self-imposed restrictions&rdquo; on their capabilities.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x4ls9\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;When we started this business we saw an opportunity,&rdquo; says Yangchan Song, DoDAAM&rsquo;s managing director of strategy planning, as we sit down in a cooled meeting room following the demonstration. &ldquo;Automated weapons will be the future. We were right. The evolution has been quick. We&rsquo;ve already moved from remote control combat devices, to what we are approaching now: smart devices that are able to make their own decisions.&rdquo;</p><p>South Korea has become a leader in this area of military robotics because the country shares a border with its sworn enemy, according to DoDAAM&rsquo;s CEO, Myung Kwang Chang (a portly man who wanders his factory&rsquo;s corridors trailed by a handsome husky with bright blue eyes whom I am warned to never, ever touch). &ldquo;Need is the mother of invention,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We live in a unique setting. We have a potent and ever-present enemy nearby. Because of this constant threat we have a tradition of developing a strong military and innovative supporting technology in this country. Our weapons don&rsquo;t sleep, like humans must. They can see in the dark, like humans can&rsquo;t. Our technology therefore plugs the gaps in human capability.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> Things become more complicated when the machine is placed in a location where friend and foe could potentially mix &nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>At the DMZ, the thin strip of no-man&rsquo;s land that separates democratic South Korea from the dictator-led North, DoDAAM and its competitor Samsung, who also designed a (now-defunct) automated turret, ran some tests with the Super aEgis II. The DMZ is the ideal location for such a weapon. The zone has separated the two Koreas since the end of official hostilities in 1953; because they never signed a ceasefire, the DMZ is an uninhabited buffer zone scrupulously guarded by thousands of soldiers on both sides. Not only does the turret never sleep and not only can it see in the dark (thanks to its thermal camera), once it's pointing in the right direction, it can be sure that any moving targets identified in the area are enemies. Things become more complicated when the machine is placed in a location where friend and foe could potentially mix, however. Currently, the weapon has no way to distinguish between the two.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x4kv5\"}}</p><p>Song sits at the wide table flanked by five young engineers, most of whom were educated at Ivy League colleges in America, before returning to work in the lucrative South Korean weapons industry. &ldquo;The next step for us to get to a place where our software can discern whether a target is friend, foe, civilian or military,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Right now humans must identify whether or not a target is an adversary.&rdquo; Park and the other engineers claim that they are close to eliminating the need for this human intervention. The Super aEgis II is accomplished at finding potential targets within an area. (An operator can even specify a virtual perimeter, so only moving elements within that area are picked out by the gun.) Then, thanks to its numerous cameras, Park says the gun&rsquo;s software can discern whether or not a potential target is wearing explosives under their shirt. &ldquo;Within a decade I think we will be able to computationally identify the type of enemy based on their uniform,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Once a weapon is able to tell friend from foe, and to automatically fire upon the latter, it&rsquo;s a short step to full automation. And as soon as a weapon can decide who and when to kill, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9l9wxGFl4k\"><em>Robocop</em>-esque science fiction</a> becomes fact. The German philosopher Thomas Metzinger has argued that the prospect of increasing the amount of suffering in the world is so morally awful that we should cease building artificially-intelligent robots immediately. But the financial rewards for companies who build these machines are such that Metzinger&rsquo;s plea is already obsolete. The robots are not coming; they are already here. The question now is, what do we teach them?</p><p><strong>Complex rules<br /> </strong></p><p>Philippa Foot&rsquo;s trolley dilemma, first posited in 1967, is familiar to any ethics student. She suggested the following scenario: a runaway train car is approaching a fork in the tracks. If it continues undiverted, a work crew of five will be struck and killed. If it steers down the other track, a lone worker will be killed. What do you, the operator, do? This kind of ethical quandary will soon have to be answered not by humans but by our machines. The self-driving car may have to decide whether or not to crash into the car in front, potentially injuring those occupants, or to swerve off the road instead, placing its own passengers in danger. (The development of Google&rsquo;s cars has been partly motivated by the designer Sebastian Thrun&rsquo;s experience of losing someone close to him in a car crash. It reportedly led to his belief that there is a moral imperative to build self-driving cars to save lives.)</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x4m58\"}}</p><p>Likewise, a fully autonomous version of the Predator drone may have to decide whether or not to fire on a house whose occupants include both enemy soldiers and civilians. How do you, as a software engineer, construct a set of rules for such a device to follow in these scenarios? Is it possible to programme a device to think for itself? For many, the simplest solution is to sidestep these questions by simply requiring any automated machine that puts human life in danger to allow a human override. This is the reason that landmines were banned by the Ottawa treaty in 1997. They were, in the most basic way imaginable, autonomous weapons that would explode whoever stepped on them.</p><p>In this context the provision of human overrides make sense. It seems obvious, for example, that pilots should have full control over a plane's autopilot system. But the 2015 Germanwings disaster, when co-pilot Andreas Lubitz deliberately crashed the plane into the French Alps, killing all 150 passengers, complicates the matter. Perhaps, in fact, <em>no</em> pilot should be allowed to over-ride a computer &ndash; at least, not if it means they are able to fly a plane into a mountainside?</p><blockquote><p> We acquire an intuitive sense of what&rsquo;s ethically acceptable by watching how others behave and react to situations &ndash; Colin Allen &nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>&ldquo;There are multiple approaches to trying to develop ethical machines, and many challenges,&rdquo; explains Gary Marcus, cognitive scientist at NYU and CEO and Founder of Geometric Intelligence. &ldquo;We could try to pre-program everything in advance, but that&rsquo;s not trivial &ndash; how for example do you program in a notion like &lsquo;fairness&rsquo; or &lsquo;harm&rsquo;?&rdquo; There is another dimension to the problem aside from ambiguous definitions. For example, any set of rules issued to an automated soldier will surely be either too abstract to be properly computable, or too specific to cover all situations.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x4m5j\"}}</p><p>Some believe the answer, then, is to mimic the way in which human beings build an ethical framework and learn to reflect on different moral rules, making sense of which ones fit together. &ldquo;We acquire an intuitive sense of what&rsquo;s ethically acceptable by watching how others behave and react to situations,&rdquo; says Colin Allen, professor of cognitive science and the philosophy of science at Indiana University, and co-author of the book Moral Machines: Teaching Robots Right From Wrong. &ldquo;In other words, we learn what is and isn&rsquo;t acceptable, ethically speaking, from others &ndash; with the danger that we may learn bad behaviours when presented with the wrong role models. Either machines will have to have similar learning capacities or they will have to have very tightly constrained spheres of action, remaining bolted to the factory floor, so to speak.&rdquo;</p><p>At DoDAAM, Park has what appears to be a sound compromise. &ldquo;When we reach the point at which we have a turret that can make fully autonomous decisions by itself, we will ensure that the AI adheres to the relevant army&rsquo;s manual. We will follow that description and incorporate those rules of engagement into our system.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>&lsquo;Frozen values&rsquo; <br /> </strong></p><p>For Allen, however, this could be a flawed plan. &ldquo;Google admits that one of the hardest problems for their programming is how an automated car should behave at a four-way stop sign,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;In this kind of scenario it&rsquo;s a matter of being attuned to local norms, rather than following the highway code &ndash; which no humans follow strictly.&rdquo; Surely, in the chaotic context of the battlefield, a robot must be able to think for itself? Likewise, there is a danger to &ldquo;freezing&rdquo; our values, both military and civilian, into hardware. &ldquo;Imagine if the US Founders had frozen their values to permit slavery, the restricted rights of women and so forth,&rdquo; says Marcus. &ldquo;Ultimately, we would probably like a machine with a very sound basis to be able to learn for itself, and maybe even exceed our abilities to reason morally.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x54fw\"}}<em><br /> </em></p><p>For Anders Sandberg, a senior researcher at the Future of Humanity Institute Oxford Martin School, the potential rewards of offering machines the ability to construct their own ethical frameworks comes with considerable risks. &ldquo;A truly self-learning system could learn different values and theories of what appropriate actions to do, and if it could reflect on itself it might become a real moral agent in the philosophical sense,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The problem is that it might learn seemingly crazy or alien values even if it starts from common-held human views.&rdquo;</p><p>The clock is ticking on these questions. Companies such as DoDAAM continue to break new ground in the field, even before our species has adequate answers to the issues their work presents. &ldquo;We should be investing now in trying to figure out how to regulate software, how to enforce those regulations, and how to verify that software does what we want it do,&rdquo; urges Marcus. &ldquo;We should also invest in figuring out how to implement ethical reasoning into machines. None of this easy; all of it is likely to became critical in the decades ahead.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> Serious research on machine ethics and AI safety is an exceptionally new field &ndash; Anders Sandberg &nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Allen believes there is still time. &ldquo;We have an opportunity to think through the ramifications and possible solutions while the technology is still in development, which has not always been the case,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I would like to see business-government-citizen panels empowered to assess and monitor the deployment of machines that are capable of operating with little or no direct human supervision in public spaces such as roads and the airways. Such panels should provide oversight in much the same way that human subjects committees monitor research involving human subjects.&rdquo;</p><p>Sandberg agrees, although he thinks that we are still some way off having workable answers that can be brought into any kind of regulation. &ldquo;More research is urgently needed, he says. &ldquo;Serious research on machine ethics and AI safety is an exceptionally new field - the first ideas started to show up in the late 1990s, decades after proper AI research was already well established. We are discovering new surprises at a high rate: both the instability of obvious means of making ethical machines, and deep philosophical problems posed by seemingly simple engineering problems.&rdquo; Sandberg believes the key is interdisciplinary work by philosophers, engineers, sociologists and even economists. &ldquo;Theory is not enough,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;We need to be engaged with the people designing and deploying these systems.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x4mjz\"}}</p><p>Back at DoDAAM&rsquo;s factory in Daejeon, the engineers do not have clear answers for these questions that are so urgently raised by their work. &ldquo;Human life is more important than anything, so that&rsquo;s why we&rsquo;ve implemented the safeguards that we have on our turret,&rdquo; says Song. But for Park and the other engineers in his research division, this is a temporary state. Their aim is now to make the product &ldquo;smarter&rdquo; by focusing on &ldquo;increasing the gun&rsquo;s automatic functionality&rdquo;, introducing &ldquo;target recognition&rdquo; and creating &ldquo;entire networked systems&rdquo;, whereby turrets link up with one another to cover greater distances.</p><p>Regardless of what&rsquo;s possible in the future, automated machine guns capable of finding, tracking, warning and eliminating human targets, absent of any human interaction already exist in our world. Without clear international regulations, the only thing holding arms makers back from selling such machines appears to be the conscience, not of the engineer or the robot, but of the clients. &ldquo;If someone came to us wanting a turret that did not have the current safeguards we would, of course, advise them otherwise, and highlight the potential issues,&rdquo; says Park. &ldquo;But they will ultimately decide what they want.

If you believe the movies, AI is something theoretical, futuristic&hellip;far away. It&rsquo;s a rampaging robot or a piece of malign code intent on world domination. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30290540\">Recent fears about AI</a> raised by the likes of Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Bill Gates have only served to feed that chilling &ndash; but pretty unlikely &ndash; sci-fi narrative. Or perhaps the AI you know is a <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-33049253\">clumsy robot failing spectacularly</a> or a chatbot churning out gobbledegook: a long, long way from human intelligence.</p><blockquote><p> The truth is, artificial intelligence surrounds us already &ndash; it just doesn&rsquo;t act in the way we expect </p></blockquote><p>The trouble with looking at AI in this way is that it obscures how the technology will actually change our lives. We joke about our future robot overlords, then return to real, human life. The truth is, artificial intelligence surrounds us already &ndash; it just doesn&rsquo;t act in the way we expect. It operates on the financial markets, it underlies search engines and is watching you at almost all times, from your internet browsing history to your <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14629058\">behaviour on CCTV</a>. You probably made a decision today that involved some sort of interaction with an intelligent machine.</p><p>That&rsquo;s why BBC Future has decided to run a special series exposing the fictions and truth of AI. Over the next two weeks, we&rsquo;ll publish thought-provoking articles, intriguing videos and mind-expanding infographics about this world-changing technology. We&rsquo;ll bust myths, and show what our future with AI will really be like.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x1ph4\"}}</p><p>BBC Future&rsquo;s Ultimate Guide to AI includes:</p><ul> <li><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150713-how-worried-should-you-be-about-artificial-intelligence\">How worried should we be about AI?

After chatting for a while and being polite, my friend asked him: &ldquo;What do you do here?&rdquo; The man explained that he was a runner from the Boston marathon who was stuck in the city because of a volcanic eruption in Iceland. Then something extraordinary happened.</p><p>The man lay down on the floor and continued to tell my friend his troubles and his story. He had a big trip planned in Europe starting in Munich, he said. However, the volcano which had been spewing rocks across the Atlantic for several weeks had, in his words, &ldquo;put the kibosh&rdquo; on that. He was honest and open in a way that surprised me.</p><p>Here is a picture my friend took of the man:</p><p>&nbsp;{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x41j2\"}}</p><p>And here is a picture of my friend:</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x41b8\"}}</p><p>The man had been conversing with a small robot I had built, called Boxie, equipped with a camera, and the ability to ask questions of the people it meets. Even though I had long realised that Boxie was capable of inspiring an emotional response, it was astounding that it could elicit intimate details from strangers so easily.</p><p>Naturally, I asked myself: &ldquo;Why would that man open up so readily to this relatively simple object?&rdquo; To keep perspective, here was a man, laying on the floor in a place where he had never been before, talking to a cardboard box with a face. While Boxie had indeed been designed to be cute, friendly, and personable with a childlike voice, surely the man understood that it was not capable of actually listening.</p><blockquote><p> I built robots capable of eliciting unexpected responses, and sent them out to meet people &ndash; everybody from passers-by to astronauts </p></blockquote><p>This experience made me wonder about a broader question concerning our future with artificial intelligence: how will we interact with social robots as they become more common? Since then, I have built various robots capable of eliciting unexpected responses, and sent them out to meet people &ndash; everybody from passers-by to astronauts. And what I have found so far suggests that artificial beings will have the capacity to influence our behaviour in ways we don&rsquo;t yet realise.&nbsp;</p><p>For a few years after Boxie, I worked on distilling the aspects of the robot which made people want to talk to and open up to it. These included making it smaller and cuter, using a child voice and improving the questions and interaction. Like Boxie, each bot also had a camera inside its head to film people&rsquo;s answers.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02x41f7\"}}</p><p>I partnered up with filmmaker and artist Brent Hoff, and sent the robots, which we called <a href=\"http://blabdroid.com/\">BlabDroids</a>, out to parks, public spaces and film festivals internationally, such as IDFA and Tribeca, to interview people in different places and cultures. The idea was to create the first documentary filmed by robots, and over the past few years, they have visited the people of the USA, the Netherlands, China, Sweden, Switzerland, Canada, the UK and others.</p><blockquote><p> When the robot interviewed the astronaut Chris Hadfield, his response was unexpected </p></blockquote><p>It didn&rsquo;t take long for us to discover that people were engaging with the robots on a level I never would have expected. Interaction time rose from an average of about eight minutes with Boxie to an average of about 30 minutes with these new robots. Furthermore, what people were revealing to the BlabDroids included very personal stories and things that you would not normally tell a stranger. (It is worth noting that the robot told its interviewees that it was recording them for a documentary to be shown later in the festival, so there was not deception to get the responses.)</p><p>Here are a few of the conversations the robot had:</p><p><strong>BlabDroid</strong>: &ldquo;What is the worst thing you have ever done to someone?&rdquo;<br /> <strong>Person 1</strong>: &ldquo;Not telling my dad I loved him before he died.&rdquo;<br /> <strong>Person 2</strong>: \"The worst thing I ever did was, um, made it so that my mother had to drown some kittens one time and I didn't realise until after that was over that it was a very difficult thing for her to do and I've never... I've never forgiven myself for making her drown some little kittens, but we couldn't keep them and I should have come up with some other way.\"<br /> <strong>BlabDroi</strong><strong>d</strong>: &ldquo;What is something you have never told a stranger before?&rdquo;<strong><br /> Person</strong>: &ldquo;When I was a kid I didn&rsquo;t like to pee in public bathrooms. So I would hold my pee until I got home. This one time I was on my bike and I could not hold it, so I peed and left a trail behind me.&rdquo;<br /> <strong>BlabDroid</strong>: &ldquo;If you could tell someone not to make the same mistake you did, what mistake would that be?&rdquo;<br /> <strong>Person 1</strong>: &ldquo;Having kids.&rdquo;</p><p>And here is the BlabDroid interviewing the astronaut Chris Hadfield. As you&rsquo;ll see, he responds in a different way to how you might expect him to talk with a human adult:</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Chris-Hadfield-meets-Blabdroid\"}}</p><p>The frank nature of the replies elicited by BlabDroid made me realise just how powerful social robots could be. Not only were people fully trusting them, they were connecting on a social level which allowed for a high level of comfort. They had entered a space in people&rsquo;s minds usually reserved for other people they trusted &ndash; and this was something significant.</p><p>You don't have one of these robots with you right now, but let's do a little experiment with a completely different kind of machine, a &ldquo;robotic sculpture&rdquo; featuring two simple balloons. Watch the video below and take note of what attributes you give to the balloons (share your answers on BBC Future&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook</a> page or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\">Twitter</a> if you wish).</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"two-mylar-balloons-attracted-an\"}}</p><p>What did you think the balloons were doing? Some responses I heard, while being a fly on the wall in the gallery where they were displayed, included everything from &ldquo;Well, they're fighting,&rdquo; to &ldquo;Oh, this is obviously about domestic violence.&rdquo; The overwhelming response was that they were in conflict. The interesting thing here is not necessarily the violent aspect, but the fact people kept saying &ldquo;they&rdquo; or &ldquo;them&rdquo; not &ldquo;it&rdquo;.</p><p>Psychologists know that we are quick to anthropomorphise inanimate objects. This was most famously depicted in an experiment in the 1940s, conducted by Fritz Heider and Marianne Simmel. They asked people to <a href=\"http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/thoughtful-animal/animating-anthropomorphism-giving-minds-to-geometric-shapes-video/\">watch a film of simple shapes interacting</a>, and found that people gave them surprisingly human-like qualities, describing a triangle as &ldquo;mean&rdquo; and &ldquo;bullying&rdquo;, while the other shapes were &ldquo;afraid&rdquo; or &ldquo;shy&rdquo;.</p><p>Another machine-based art project I designed with Alicia Eggert in 2012 also provoked people to anthropomorphise &ndash; but this time, it made some of them feel uncomfortable.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Pulse-Machine\"}}</p><p>We called it the pulse machine. A kick drum was fitted with a robotic striker which was attached to a countdown mechanism. The machine was &ldquo;born&rdquo; during the opening and was given the lifespan a person who was born on that day would have (about 78 years). The machine started its pulse and slowly counted down to its demise. With only this simple setup, people had very different yet extremely personal reactions to it. Some felt that it was morbid and were visually upset by it. Others felt it gave them some energy to go out and do something; it reminded them that life was short. One person said that it had made them sad, as it reminded them of the recent passing of their loved one.</p><blockquote><p> Our propensity to form bonds with machines is already becoming apparent </p></blockquote><p>I found it quite profound that these strong emotions occurred from just a drum and countdown clock. To those who viewed it, the machine was born, is alive, and is now dying. This really drove home the fact that very little was required for people to anthropomorphise an object. It also showed just how empathetic we are as people and that we can empathise with things which are not us.</p><p>Indeed, our propensity to form bonds with machines is already becoming apparent as they become a bigger part of our lives: some soldiers are known to mourn their bomb-disposal robots, and owners of Aibo dogs in Japan have staged funerals for their robotic pet dogs. If a machine can become the embodiment of a living thing, the effect of it &ldquo;dying&rdquo; can lead to a very real mourning.</p><p>All of which raises some difficult ethical questions as we build robots that are smarter and better able to converse with us. How personal and &ldquo;real&rdquo; do we want these robots to be? At what point does a robot designed to trigger our emotions become manipulative? Where does one draw the line?</p><blockquote><p> One of the possibilities this opens up is automating aspects of our emotional lives where we usually depend on other people for sympathy </p></blockquote><p>As the philosopher John Campbell told me: &ldquo;One of the possibilities this opens up is automating aspects of our emotional lives where we usually depend on other people for sympathy and support. Rather than relying on your partner to listen to the problems you&rsquo;ve had at work all day, why not explain them to a sympathetic robot that makes eye contact with you, listens with apparent interest, making all the right noises, remembers and cross-indexes everything you say?&rdquo;</p><p>Once we accept a machine is alive, any relationship we form with it will be on the same level as any other living thing. Thus, robots are truly alive in our minds; which is perhaps more significant to the future of human-machine relationships than any Turing test. A robot doesn&rsquo;t need to convince us it is human &ndash; we&rsquo;re ready to believe it already.</p><p><em>This article is based on a forthcoming book by artist and engineer </em><a href=\"http://areben.com/\"><em>Alexander Reben</em></a><em>.</em> <em>The BlabDroids and other robots will be on show at the </em><a href=\"http://www.cjamesgallery.com/show-detail/engineering-psychology\"><em>Charlie James Gallery in Los Angeles from 15-29 August</em></a><em>.</p><p></em><em>Follow us</em>&nbsp;<em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em><strong>Google+</strong></em></a>&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><strong><em>LinkedIn</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-07-15T10:31:52.501Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"How robots mess with our minds","HeadlineShort":"Machines that mess with your mind","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Robots can make you do surprising things, says Alexander Reben, whose talking bots have elicited secrets from passers-by, festival-goers and even astronauts.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":[],"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"Robots can make you do surprising things, says Alexander Reben, whose talking bots have elicited secrets from passers-by, festival-goers and even astronauts.","SummaryShort":"They can reveal your deepest secrets","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-07-15T10:02:01.686995Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"4f09d842-7a92-4cc1-ab22-a05091eeb2ac","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150715-how-robots-mess-with-our-minds","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-07-16T12:00:09.188481Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150715-how-robots-mess-with-our-minds"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150715-how-robots-mess-with-our-minds","_id":"55dc5862983c37e31d30d102"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":null,"AssetSelect":"ib2video","AssetVideoIb2":[],"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":null,"BodyHtml":"<p>Imagine we had invented a computer that could act like a human in every possible way.

It says it has even conducted a test of the system, which uses a solid-state fibre laser, to destroy small-caliber rockets from 1.2 miles (2km) away.</p><p>Although it <a href=\"http://www.lockheedmartin.com/us/news/press-releases/2012/november/1127-ss-adam.html\">put out a press release</a>, Lockheed is keeping a close hold on its technology and the company declined interviews about the ground-based weapon. &ldquo;We have demonstrated that the commercial 10-kilowatt laser, when focused by our innovative beam control software, has sufficient power to negate the close-in threats&hellip;,&rdquo; Lynn Fisher, a Lockheed spokeswoman told BBC Future. &ldquo;At this time, 10 kilowatts is the highest single-mode power available in a commercial laser with sufficient beam quality for this application.&rdquo;</p><p>Lockheed is one of several firm&rsquo;s that has pursued laser weapons since the 1970s for a range of applications and military services. The Army has already used lasers for exploding mines and ordnance, whilst the Navy is interested in using them to &ldquo;neutralize threats&rdquo;, including drones, boats or missiles. In 2011, it <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awsQs4ct0c4\">released a video</a> of a test in which its so-called Maritime Laser Demonstrator burnt a hole in the engine of a small boat.</p><p>Other firms, such as Northrop Grumman already have developed <a href=\"http://www.irconnect.com/noc/press/pages/news_releases.html?d=154600\">a mobile weapon called the Firestrike</a>, &nbsp;which the company says it powerful enough to be used on the battlefield&mdash;or at sea.</p><p><strong>Toxic trouble</strong></p><p>However, despite being long promised, the use of laser weapons is limited. The systems that exist today are often too big or complex for real world applications. And critics say the latest burst of interest merely reflects a decades&rsquo; long tendency to overestimate the capabilities of lasers, while underestimating the operational and technical difficulties of using such weapons for missile defence.</p><p>One example of this was the Airborne Laser, which was to be flown in the nose cone of a Boeing 747 and was designed to take down intercontinental ballistic missiles in their vulnerable boost phase. Former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, said the operational concept, which involved flying an undefended plane into potentially hostile areas, was unrealistic and canceled the project.</p><p>Other laser projects have suffered similar fates. Subrata Ghoshroy, a research associate at the Massachusetts of Institute of Technology, recalls working as a congressional staff member in the mid-1990s when he was briefed on the Nautilus laser, which was jointly sponsored by the United States and Israel.</p><p>Nautilus was a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_laser\">chemical laser</a>, so-named because it obtains its energy from a chemical reaction, which was designed to shoot down Soviet Katyusha rockets. Even then Ghoshroy expressed his doubts about the project, however.</p><p>&ldquo;This particular laser was using deuterium fluoride, chemical laser technology, which is extremely toxic and difficult to handle,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;There would be canisters of this stuff sitting in the desert; one Katyusha rocket hitting a canister is a huge problem.&rdquo;</p><p>The developers were eventually able to demonstrate on a test range that they could take down a rocket, but the tracking system wasn&rsquo;t very good, according to Ghoshroy. After a decade of effort and hundreds of millions of dollars, the laser effort was cancelled, and Israel instead deployed Iron Dome.</p><p>&ldquo;My concerns were validated once the whole thing was abandoned,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Ivan Oelrich, a defense analyst who has advised on military technology issues for several decades, is equally dubious of the near-term prospect of laser weapons for defeating rockets and missiles. &ldquo;The problem is these things look great when you test them at White Sands,&rdquo; says Oelrich, referring to the Army range in New Mexico used for testing lasers. &ldquo;In the real world, all these lasers have limitations based on what&rsquo;s going on in the atmosphere.&rdquo;</p><p>Haze, fog, or other poor weather conditions can degrade the laser&rsquo;s effectiveness&mdash;and that provides an advantage to would-be attackers. &ldquo;If I know I&rsquo;m going to have a cloudy day tomorrow, I&rsquo;ll launch my rockets then,&rdquo; says Oelrich.</p><p><strong>Money talks</strong></p><p>Oelrich suggests that another problem is that attackers might be able to come up with simple countermeasures to such laser weapons, such as painting their rockets white, which would allow them to reflect heat. Or, another idea, slightly more technical, but still easily doable, is to find out what the wavelength of the laser would be, and then cover the missile with material that would deflect it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t add a lot of weight, so why would I not do that?&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Yet there are still laser enthusiasts who argue that the technology has a role to play as part of a more comprehensive approach to missile defense. Mark Gunzinger, a retired Air Force colonel and former Pentagon official, argues that new high-power lasers, particularly newer <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid-state_laser\">solid-state lasers</a>, offer a &ldquo;complementary approach&rdquo; to systems that deploy interceptors. &nbsp;</p><p>One of the problems pointed out with interceptors, such as Iron Dome, is that it often ends up costing much more for the defender to take down a rocket than for an aggressor to launch it. Laser weapons, by contrast, are theoretically cheaper since they can shoot a near infinite number of times.</p><p>Gunzinger, now a senior fellow at the Washington, DC-based Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, argues that laser weapons have the potential to change &ldquo;the negative cost ratio back in your favor.</p><p>While Gunzinger points to growing support for solid-state lasers, particularly from the Navy, he says a chemical laser like the one developed for the Airborne Laser could prove useful. &nbsp;&ldquo;You could take an upgraded version of the Airborne Laser&rsquo;s weapon system and use it to defend forward areas, forward air bases, from medium and even short range ballistic missiles,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The technology is there: It&rsquo;s a question of if someone wants to fund it.&rdquo;</p><p>And that&rsquo;s the problem - with the US administration facing the fiscal cliff, the prospects of funding a major laser weapon system is unlikely at best.</p><p>But even if it were affordable, it&rsquo;s not clear it&rsquo;s desirable. &ldquo;One of the things you have to ask yourself when dusting off an old idea is that if we decided not to do this last time, what&rsquo;s different now?&rdquo; says Oelrich. For laser weapons that answer still may be unclear.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook page</a> or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:14:40Z","HeadlineLong":"Laser weapons shine on","HeadlineShort":"Laser weapons shine on","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Powerful, military lasers - promised for decades and now being touted again – have failed to take off.

At a workshop she organised this year, Darling asked people to play with a Pleo robot, a child&rsquo;s toy dinosaur. The soft green Pleo has trusting eyes and affectionate movements. When you take one out of the box, it acts like a helpless newborn puppy &ndash; it can&rsquo;t walk and you have to teach it about the world.</p><p>Yet after an hour allowing people to tickle and cuddle these loveable dinosaurs, Darling turned executioner. She gave the participants knives, hatchets and other weapons, and ordered them to torture and dismember their toys. What happened next &ldquo;was much more dramatic than we ever anticipated,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>For Darling, a researcher at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, our reaction to robot cruelty is important because a new wave of machines is forcing us to reconsider our relationship with them. When Darling described her Pleo experiment in <a href=\"http://www.ethanzuckerman.com/blog/2013/11/19/kate-darling-on-robot-ethics/\">a talk in Boston this month</a>, she made the case that mistreating certain kinds of robots could soon become unacceptable in the eyes of society. She even believes that we may need a set of &ldquo;robot rights&rdquo;. If so, in what circumstance would it be OK to torture or murder a robot? And what would it take to make you think twice before being cruel to a machine?</p><p>Until recently, the idea of robot rights had been left to the realms of science fiction. Perhaps that&rsquo;s because the real machines surrounding us have been relatively unsophisticated. Nobody feels bad about chucking away a toaster or a remote-control toy car. Yet the arrival of social robots changes that. They display autonomous behaviour, show intent and embody familiar forms like pets or humanoids, says Darling. In other words, they act as if they are alive. It triggers our emotions, and often we can&rsquo;t help it.</p><p>For example, in a small experiment conducted for the radio show Radiolab in 2011, Freedom Baird of MIT asked children to hold upside down <a href=\"http://www.radiolab.org/story/137469-furbidden-knowledge/\">a Barbie doll, a hamster and a Furby robot</a> for as long as they felt comfortable. While the children held the doll upside down until their arms got tired, they soon stopped torturing the wriggling hamster, and after a little while, the Furby too. They were old enough to know the Furby was a toy, but couldn&rsquo;t stand the way it was programmed to cry and say &ldquo;Me scared&rdquo;.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not just kids that form surprising bonds with these bundles of wires and circuits. Some people give names to their Roomba vacuum cleaners, says Darling. And soldiers honour their robots with &ldquo;medals&rdquo; or hold funerals for them. She cites one particularly striking example of a <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/05/AR2007050501009.html\">military robot that was designed to defuse landmines by stepping on them</a>. In a test, the explosions ripped off most of the robot&rsquo;s legs, and yet the crippled machine continued to limp along. Watching the robot struggle, the colonel in charge called off the test because it was &ldquo;inhumane&rdquo;, according to the Washington Post.</p><p><strong>Killer instinct</strong></p><p>Some researchers are converging on the idea that if a robot looks like it is alive, with its own mind, the tiniest of simulated cues forces us to feel empathy with machines, even though we know they are artificial.</p><p>Earlier this year, researchers from the University of Duisburg-Essen in Germany used an fMRI scanner and devices that measure skin conductance to track people&rsquo;s reactions to a video of somebody <a href=\"http://spectrum.ieee.org/robotics/artificial-intelligence/brain-scans-show-humans-feel-for-robots\">torturing a Pleo dinosaur</a> &ndash; choking it, putting it inside a plastic bag or striking it. The physiological and emotional responses they measured were much stronger than expected, despite being aware they were watching a robot.</p><p>Darling discovered the same when she asked people to torture the Pleo dinosaur <a href=\"http://videos.liftconference.com/video/7778257/harming-and-protecting-robots\">at the Lift conference in Geneva in February</a>. The workshop took a more uncomfortable turn than expected.</p><p>After an hour of play, the people refused to hurt their Pleo with the weapons they had been given. So then Darling started playing mind games, telling them they could save their own dinosaur by killing somebody else&rsquo;s. Even then, they wouldn&rsquo;t do it.</p><p>Finally, she told the group that unless one person stepped forward and killed just one Pleo, all the robots would be slaughtered. After much hand-wringing, one reluctant man stepped forward with his hatchet, and delivered a blow to a toy.</p><p>After this brutal act, the room fell silent for a few seconds, Darling recalls. The strength of people&rsquo;s emotional reaction seemed to have surprised them.</p><p>Given the possibility of such strong emotional reactions, a few years ago <a href=\"http://www.epsrc.ac.uk/research/ourportfolio/themes/engineering/activities/Pages/principlesofrobotics.aspx\">roboticists in Europe argued that we need new set of ethical rules for building robots</a>. The idea was to adapt author Isaac Asimov&rsquo;s famous &ldquo;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Laws_of_Robotics\">laws of robotics</a>&rdquo; for the modern age. One of their five rules was that robots &ldquo;should not be designed in a deceptive way... their machine nature must be transparent&rdquo;. In other words, there needs to be a way to break the illusion of emotion and intent, and see a robot for what it is: wires, actuators and software.</p><p>Darling, however, believes that we could go further than a few ethical guidelines. We may need to protect &ldquo;robot rights&rdquo; in our legal systems, she says.</p><p>If this sounds sound absurd, Darling points out that there are precedents from animal cruelty laws. Why exactly do we have legal protection for animals? Is it simply because they can suffer? If that&rsquo;s true, then Darling questions why we have strong laws to protect some animals, but not others. Many people are happy to eat animals kept in awful conditions on industrial farms or to crush an insect under their foot, yet would be aghast at mistreatment of their next-door neighbour&rsquo;s cat, or seeing a whale harvested for meat.</p><p>The reason, says Darling, could be that we create laws when we recognise their suffering as similar to our own. Perhaps the main reason we created many of these laws is because we don&rsquo;t like to see the act of cruelty. It&rsquo;s less about the animal&rsquo;s experience and more about our own emotional pain. So, even though robots are machines, Darling argues that there may be a point beyond which the <em>performance</em> of cruelty &ndash; rather than its consequences &ndash; is too uncomfortable to tolerate.</p><p><strong>Feel your pain</strong></p><p>Indeed, harm to a victim is not always the only reason we decide to regulate a technology. Consider an altogether different kind of gadget: a few weeks ago the British Medical Association argued that <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-24908600\">smoking e-cigarettes should be banned in public indoor spaces</a> in the UK. It doesn&rsquo;t matter that the smoker or those nearby face no health risks, the BMA argued. It normalises real smoking in public places once again.</p><p>To take another example: if a father is torturing a robot in front of his 4-year-old son, would that be acceptable? The child can't be expected to have the sophisticated understanding of adults. Torturing a robot teaches them that acts that cause suffering &ndash; simulated or not &ndash; are OK in some circumstances.</p><p>Or to take it to an extreme: imagine if somebody were to take one of the <a href=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-06/14/robot-learns-like-babies\">childlike robots</a> already being built in labs, and sell it to a paedophile who planned to live out their darkest desires. Should a society allow this to happen?</p><p>Such questions about apparently victimless evil are already playing out in the virtual world. Earlier this year, the <a href=\"http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2013/09/grand-theft-auto-v-how-evil-should-a-video-game-allow-you-to-be.html\">New Yorker described the moral quandaries</a> raised when an online forum discussing Grand Theft Auto asked players if rape was acceptable inside the game. One replied: &ldquo;I want to have the opportunity to kidnap a woman, hostage her, put her in my basement and rape her everyday, listen to her crying, watching her tears.&rdquo; If such unpleasant desires could be actually lived with a physical robotic being that simulates a victim, it may make it more difficult to tolerate.</p><p>Somewhere down the line there&rsquo;s also the possibility of a nasty twist: that machines really could experience suffering &ndash; just not like our own. Already some researchers have begun making <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21829171.900-consciousness-why-we-need-to-build-sentient-machines.html?full=true#.UpNopScXIyZ\">robots &ldquo;feel&rdquo; pain to navigate the world</a>. Some are concerned that when machines eventually acquire a basic sense of their own existence, the consequences will not be pleasant. For this reason, the philosopher Thomas Metzinger argues that we should stop trying to create intelligent robots at all. The first conscious machines, says Metzinger, will be like confused, disabled infants &ndash; certainly not the sophisticated, malign AI of science fiction &ndash; and so treating them like typical machines would be cruel. If robots have a basic consciousness, then it doesn&rsquo;t matter if it is simulated, he says. It believes it is alive, it can experience suffering. Metzinger puts it like this: &ldquo;We should refrain from doing anything to increase the overall amount of suffering in the universe.&rdquo;</p><p>What&rsquo;s clear is that there is a spectrum of &ldquo;aliveness&rdquo; in robots, from basic simulations of cute animal behaviour, to future robots that acquire a sense of suffering. But as Darling&rsquo;s Pleo dinosaur experiment suggested, it doesn&rsquo;t take much to trigger an emotional response in us. The question is whether we can &ndash; or should &ndash; define the line beyond which cruelty to these machines is unacceptable. Where does the line lie for you? If a robot cries out in pain, or begs for mercy? If it believes it is hurting? If it bleeds?</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"> <em>Facebook page</em></a><em> or message us on</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"> <em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-11-27T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Is it OK to torture or murder a robot?","HeadlineShort":"Would you murder a robot?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We form such strong emotional bonds with machines that people can’t be cruel to them even though they know they are not alive.

You have the same upbringing, the same IQ, the same education, the same interests. Both of you are equally gregarious, equally adventurous, equally interesting. You both work out at the same gym, and eat the same food.</p><p>Spiritually and mentally, you are doppelgangers.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s just one small difference: your faces. Maybe one of you has the kind of wide-eyed, childlike features of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galago\">bush baby</a>. Maybe the other has stronger cheekbones and a more rugged (some might say Neanderthal) brow.</p><p>Over the years, how do you think your lives would play out? Would you follow the same routes in life, or would the subtle differences in your appearance help send you on alternative paths?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wj4gg\"}}</p><blockquote><p> Within a split-second, others judge whether you are competent and trustworthy; whether you are a leader or a follower </p></blockquote><p>Sadly, the answer is the latter. Within a split-second of laying eyes on you, others will have decided whether you are competent and trustworthy; whether you are a leader or a follower. And those prejudices might shape key events in your life, determining everything from your friendships to your bank balance.</p><p>&ldquo;Although we like to think we make decisions in a rational way, we are often swayed by superficial cues,&rdquo; says Christopher Olivola at Carnegie Mellon University. &ldquo;And appearances are a particularly superficial, yet very strong cue.&rdquo;</p><p>In the past, this &ldquo;face-ism&rdquo; (as Olivola and his colleagues call it) was considered an unfortunate fact of life. But the more they come to understand its pervasive influence, the more they are beginning to wonder if it should be treated like any other prejudice. If so, it could be time to take action.</p><blockquote><p> Armed robbery is one of the only professions where beauty is never a virtue </p></blockquote><p>Given our obsession with celebrity culture, physical beauty may appear the greatest source of face-ism. Beginning as early as the 1990s, economist Daniel Hamermesh has found that more attractive people can earn 10 to 12% more &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.economicrockstar.com/danhamermesh/\">for professionals as diverse as American football players, lawyers</a>, and even his fellow economists. &ldquo;Which is a scary thought,&rdquo; he says today. In fact, one of the only exceptions, he found, was armed robbers. &ldquo;If he can scare you into giving you the money, he doesn&rsquo;t need to use violence.&rdquo; <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150213-the-downsides-of-being-beautiful\">Indeed, as BBC Future has explored before, good looks aren&rsquo;t always a golden ticket</a> for the law-abiding, either. A woman considered to be more beautiful, for instance, may find it harder to get a top job if the interviewers thought it undermined her credibility.</p><p>In any case, our preoccupation with beauty may have caused us to neglect the many other forms of facial prejudice, as Olivola&rsquo;s colleague Alexander Todorov at Princeton University found 10 years ago. He asked participants to look at photos of US politicians running for Congress and Senate for just one second and then to judge how &ldquo;competent&rdquo; they looked on a numerical scale. Even when he took into account other factors, such as age and attractiveness, the participants&rsquo; snap judgements <a href=\"http://tlab.princeton.edu/publication_files/Todorov_Science2005.pdf\">predicted who would win a seat with nearly 70% accuracy</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wj48t\"}}</p><p>More recent studies have shown similar results, all examining how facial appearance feeds success, irrespective of your sex appeal. The more dominant you look, the more likely you are to be hired as a CEO &ndash; and <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1571469\">the higher your pay packet</a>, for example. In the military, meanwhile, scientists have asked people to judge faces of cadets for perceived dominance. Those with the higher ratings were more likely to climb the ranks later in life.</p><p>Honesty, in particular, is thought to show itself all over your face. When given a range of photos, participants mostly agree who looks more trustworthy &ndash; and <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0034293#pone-0034293-g003\">they are more likely to lend that person money as a result</a>. In court, an innocent face could even be your get-out-of-jail-free card; given the same evidence, <a href=\"https://people.ok.ubc.ca/stporter/Publications_files/Dangerous%20Decision%20Theory%20-%20mock%20jury%20study%20FINAL.pdf\">people who look more trustworthy are less likely to be found guilty</a>, one study found.</p><p>Admittedly, this centres on completely subjective reports. How do we know what makes an honest, competent or dominant face? One possibility is that we are simply responding to facial expressions &ndash; an open smile, or an angry frown. There&rsquo;s no doubt that it does make a difference. Even so, the evidence suggests we are also reading other, more permanent cues. For instance, Olivola and Todorov have used carefully designed computer generated pictures with neutral expressions to control for all other factors.&nbsp; By asking subjects to rate them, and comparing the ratings of many different photos, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661314002095\">the team has then been able to create a kind of digital photo-fit that best captures the subtle characteristics that signal each trait</a>. The resulting pictures suggest that we are reacting to slight differences across the whole face &ndash; everything from the shape of the eye-brows to the underlying bone structure. See the faces below to judge whether you look particularly competent, dominant, extrovert or trustworthy.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wj54h\"}}</p><p>You might like to think that you would never be so shallow &ndash; but the fact is that whenever you meet someone, you spontaneously appraise them. In fact, Todorov has shown that 40 milliseconds are all it takes to form a rapid impression of someone&rsquo;s personality &ndash; that&rsquo;s about a tenth as long as a single blink of the eye. What&rsquo;s more, it appears to be a life-long habit: even three- and four-year-olds <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/25/5/1132.short\">decide who looks &ldquo;mean&rdquo; or &ldquo;nice</a>&rdquo; based solely on appearances.</p><blockquote><p> It&rsquo;s hard to understand why we might have evolved a sign on our face saying &lsquo;don&rsquo;t trust me' </p></blockquote><p>Those fleeting judgements may not be so worrying, if they were mostly accurate. And indeed, they do contain a small kernel of truth. Jean-Francois Bonnefon at CNRS in France and colleagues recently asked participants to play an economic game &ndash; in which they were given a few euros and could decide whether or not to invest it in another player, who could then choose whether to keep (the dishonest option) or share their profits (the honest option). Based solely on a single photo, <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167487015000033\">the participants turned out to be able to predict what route their competitor would take</a>, slightly better than that of pure chance. It raises some interesting evolutionary questions, he says. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to understand why we might have a sign on our face saying &lsquo;don&rsquo;t trust me'.\" As <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150312-what-the-face-betrays-about-you\">BBC Future has explored before</a>, your face can also reveal secrets the levels of your hormones or the health of your immune system.</p><p>Practically speaking, though, our accuracy is so poor it probably does more harm than good. &ldquo;People put too much weight on appearances and neglect what they already know,&rdquo; says Olivola. In games measuring trust and honesty, for instance, participants are willing to trust someone with an innocent-looking face, even when there is already tangible evidence that their partner has cheated beforehand.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02wj44s\"}}</p><p>It&rsquo;s not hard to see how these kinds of rapid first impressions could begin to lead you and your imaginary twin down very different trajectories. &nbsp;Whether you are entering a party, meeting your in-laws, attending a job interview or applying for a bank loan &ndash; your looks could be deciding your fate. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a particular thorny issue in today&rsquo;s hyper-connected world, says Olivola. &ldquo;Nowadays, with online profiles, we can form impressions before we talk to someone, before we even meet them.&rdquo; Suppose you are hiring a new assistant. You may have every intention of reviewing a CV objectively, but once a photo has planted a seed of bias in your mind, it may be too late. &ldquo;It can change the way we interpret the subsequent information,&rdquo; he says. Bonnefon agrees. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s probably impossible to train people not to make the impressions &ndash; it&rsquo;s an automatic behaviour.&rdquo;</p><p>Given these concerns, Olivola and Todorov recently wrote a paper arguing that psychologists should begin to investigate ways to combat <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661314002095\">face-ism</a>. &ldquo;If a decision is important, I would try to structure the information so that faces come at the end of the decision process,&rdquo; says Todorov. &ldquo;When we interview graduate students for admission, I know whether I would like to work with them before I meet them. The most important information is in their past performance and their letters of reference.&rdquo; Olivola even suggests you could interview candidates behind a screen, although he agrees it may not be a realistic solution. Many professional orchestras, however, have found that blind auditions can reduce the influence of other prejudices &ndash; one study found they significantly improve the selection chances of female musicians, for example.</p><blockquote><p> Do we want to spend government money protecting bad looking people when other groups merit more attention? </p></blockquote><p>As Hamermesh argues in his book <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9516.html\">Beauty Pays</a>, prejudice based on appearances could be a legal issue &ndash; if you can prove that you are not earning as much as your more-attractive colleague. Creating and implementing new laws costs money, however, and he&rsquo;s not sure that this warrants the resources when there are more pressing matters at hand. &ldquo;The question is, do we want to spend government money protecting bad looking people when &ndash; it&rsquo;s my personal view &ndash; other groups merit more attention?&rdquo; he says. Certainly, no one is claiming that face-ism should eclipse our efforts to fight other kinds of prejudices &ndash; like sexism or racism.

Popular opinion would have it so. We tend to think of geniuses as being plagued by existential angst, frustration, and loneliness. Think of Virginia Woolf, Alan Turing, or Lisa Simpson &ndash; lone stars, isolated even as they burn their brightest. As Ernest Hemingway wrote: &ldquo;Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> The harsh truth is that greater intelligence does not equate to wiser decisions </p></blockquote><p>The question may seem like a trivial matter concerning a select few &ndash; but the insights it offers could have ramifications for many. Much of our education system is aimed at improving academic intelligence; although its limits are well known, IQ is still the primary way of measuring cognitive abilities, and we spend millions on brain training and cognitive enhancers that try to improve those scores. But what if the quest for genius is itself a fool&rsquo;s errand?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02p2q0x\"}}</p><p>The first steps to answering these questions were taken almost a century ago, at the height of the American Jazz Age. At the time, the new-fangled IQ test was gaining traction, after proving itself in World War One recruitment centres, and in 1926, psychologist Lewis Terman decided to use it to identify and study a group of gifted children. Combing California&rsquo;s schools for the creme de la creme, he selected 1,500 pupils with an IQ of 140 or more &ndash; 80 of whom had IQs above 170. Together, they became known as the &ldquo;Termites&rdquo;, and the highs and lows of their lives are still being studied to this day.</p><blockquote><p> The Termites&rsquo; average salary was twice that of the average white-collar job </p></blockquote><p>As you might expect, many of the Termites did achieve wealth and fame &ndash; most notably Jess Oppenheimer, the writer of the classic 1950s sitcom <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Lucy\">I Love Lucy</a>. Indeed, by the time his series aired on CBS, the Termites&rsquo; average salary was <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=7IWaAAAAIAAJ&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;ots=8z6o5onaTV&amp;dq=terman%20salary%20gifted%201955&amp;pg=PA100#v=onepage&amp;q=terman%20salary%20gifted%201955&amp;f=false\">twice that of the average white-collar job</a>. But not all the group met Terman&rsquo;s expectations &ndash; there were many who pursued more &ldquo;humble&rdquo; professions such as police officers, seafarers, and typists. For this reason, Terman concluded that &ldquo;intellect and achievement are far from perfectly correlated&rdquo;. Nor did their smarts endow personal happiness. Over the course of their lives, levels of <a href=\"https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=40678\">divorce, alcoholism and suicide</a> were about the same as the national average.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02p2q4s\"}}</p><p>As the Termites enter their dotage, the moral of their story &ndash; that intelligence does not equate to a better life &ndash; has been told again and again. At best, a great intellect makes no differences to your life satisfaction; at worst, <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15427609.2014.936182#.VR1XHRCtaFE\">it can actually mean you are less fulfilled</a>.</p><p>That&rsquo;s not to say that everyone with a high IQ is a tortured genius, as popular culture might suggest &ndash; but it is nevertheless puzzling. Why don&rsquo;t the benefits of sharper intelligence pay off in the long term?</p><p><strong><br /> A weighty burden</strong></p><p>One possibility is that knowledge of your talents becomes something of a ball and chain. Indeed, during the 1990s, the surviving Termites were asked to look back at the events in their 80-year lifespan. Rather than basking in their successes, many reported that they had been plagued by the sense that they had somehow <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10400121\">failed to live up to their youthful expectations</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02p2q6s\"}}</p><p>That sense of burden &ndash; particularly when combined with others&rsquo; expectations &ndash; is a recurring motif for <a href=\"https://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=351315\">many other gifted children</a>. The most notable, and sad, case concerns the maths prodigy Sufiah Yusof. Enrolled at Oxford University aged 12, she dropped out of her course before taking her finals and started waitressing. She later worked as a call girl, <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-557568/I-love-girl--Im-control-boasts-fallen-child-genius.html\">entertaining clients with her ability to recite equations during sexual acts</a>.</p><blockquote><p> Sufiah Yusof, a child prodigy, enrolled at Oxford aged 12 but later dropped out and worked as a call girl &nbsp; </p></blockquote><p>Another common complaint, often heard in student bars and <a href=\"http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-disadvantages-of-being-smart\">internet forums</a>, is that smarter people somehow have a clearer vision of the world&rsquo;s failings. Whereas the rest of us are blinkered from existential angst, smarter people lay awake agonising over the human condition or other people&rsquo;s folly.</p><p>Constant worrying may, in fact, be a sign of intelligence &ndash; but not in the way these armchair philosophers had imagined. Interviewing students on campus about various topics of discussion, Alexander Penney at MacEwan University in Canada found that those with the higher IQ did indeed <a href=\"http://digest.bps.org.uk/2014/12/is-being-worrier-sign-of-intelligence.html\">feel more anxiety throughout the day</a>. Interestingly, most worries were mundane, day-to-day concerns, though; the high-IQ students were far more likely to be replaying an awkward conversation, than asking the &ldquo;big questions&rdquo;. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that their worries were more profound, but they are just worrying more often about more things,&rdquo; says Penney. &ldquo;If something negative happened, they thought about it more.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02p2q98\"}}</p><p>Probing more deeply, Penney found that this seemed to correlate with verbal intelligence &ndash; the kind tested by word games in IQ tests, compared to prowess at spatial puzzles (which, in fact, seemed to reduce the risk of anxiety). He speculates that greater eloquence might also make you more likely to verbalise anxieties and ruminate over them. It&rsquo;s not necessarily a disadvantage, though. &ldquo;Maybe they were problem-solving a bit more than most people,&rdquo; he says &ndash; which might help them to learn from their mistakes.</p><p><strong>Mental blind spots</strong></p><p>The harsh truth, however, is that greater intelligence does not equate to wiser decisions; in fact, in some cases it might make your choices a little more foolish. Keith Stanovich at the University of Toronto has spent the last decade building tests for rationality, and he has found that fair, unbiased decision-making is largely independent of IQ. Consider the &ldquo;my-side bias&rdquo; &ndash; our tendency to be highly selective in the information we collect so that it reinforces our previous attitudes. The more enlightened approach would be to leave your assumptions at the door as you build your argument &ndash; but <a href=\"http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/22/4/259.abstract\">Stanovich found that smarter people are almost no more likely to do so than </a>people with distinctly average IQs.</p><blockquote><p> People who ace cognitive tests are more likely to see past their own flaws </p></blockquote><p>That&rsquo;s not all. People who ace standard cognitive tests are in fact slightly more likely to have a &ldquo;bias blind spot&rdquo;. That is, <a href=\"http://www4.ncsu.edu/~jlnietfe/Metacog_Articles_files/West,%20Meserve,%20%26%20Stanovich%20%282012%29.pdf\">they are less able to see their own flaws, even when though they are quite capable of criticising the foibles of others</a>. And they have a greater tendency to fall for the <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0047019\">&ldquo;gambler&rsquo;s fallacy&rdquo;</a> &ndash; the idea that if a tossed coin turns heads 10 times, it will be more likely to fall tails on the 11th. The fallacy has been the ruination of roulette players planning for a red after a string of blacks, and it can also lead stock investors to sell their shares before they reach peak value &ndash; in the belief that their luck has to run out sooner or later.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02p2qfp\"}}</p><p>A tendency to rely on gut instincts rather than rational thought might also explain why a surprisingly high number of <a href=\"https://www.mensa.org/\">Mensa</a> members believe in the paranormal; or why someone with an IQ of 140 is about <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289607000219\">twice as likely to max out their credit card</a>.</p><p>Indeed, Stanovich sees these biases in every strata of society. &ldquo;There is plenty of dysrationalia &ndash; people doing irrational things despite more than adequate intelligence &ndash; in our world today,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The people pushing the anti-vaccination meme on parents and spreading misinformation on websites are generally of more than average intelligence and education.&rdquo; Clearly, clever people can be dangerously, and foolishly, misguided.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02p2qhg\"}}</p><p>So if intelligence doesn&rsquo;t lead to rational decisions and a better life, what does? Igor Grossmann, at the University of Waterloo in Canada, thinks we need to turn our minds to an age-old concept: &ldquo;wisdom&rdquo;. His approach is more scientific that it might at first sound. &ldquo;The concept of wisdom has an ethereal quality to it,&rdquo; he admits. &ldquo;But if you look at the lay definition of wisdom, many people would agree it&rsquo;s the idea of someone who can make good unbiased judgement.&rdquo;</p><p>In one experiment, Grossmann presented his volunteers with different social dilemmas &ndash; ranging from what to do about the war in Crimea to heartfelt crises disclosed to <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/linkset/2005/03/25/LI2005032502583.html\">Dear Abby</a>, the Washington Post&rsquo;s agony aunt. As the volunteers talked, a panel of psychologists judged their reasoning and weakness to bias: whether it was a rounded argument, whether the candidates were ready to admit the limits of their knowledge &ndash; their &ldquo;intellectual humility&rdquo; &ndash; and whether they were ignoring important details that didn&rsquo;t fit their theory.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02p2qkx\"}}</p><p>High scores turned out to predict <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3594053/\">greater life satisfaction, relationship quality, and, crucially, reduced anxiety and rumination</a> &ndash; all the qualities that seem to be absent in classically smart people. Wiser reasoning even seemed to ensure a longer life &ndash; those with the higher scores were less likely to die over intervening years. Crucially, Grossmann found that IQ was not related to any of these measures, and certainly didn&rsquo;t predict greater wisdom. &ldquo;People who are very sharp may generate, very quickly, arguments [for] why their claims are the correct ones &ndash; but may do it in a very biased fashion.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Learnt wisdom</strong></p><p>In the future, employers may well begin to start testing these abilities in place of IQ; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/23/opinion/sunday/friedman-how-to-get-a-job-at-google.html\">Google has already announced that it plans to screen candidates for qualities like intellectual humility</a>, rather than sheer cognitive prowess.</p><p>Fortunately, wisdom is probably not set in stone &ndash; whatever your IQ score. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a strong believer that wisdom can be trained,&rdquo; says Grossmann. He points out that we often find it easier to leave our biases behind when we consider other people, rather than ourselves. Along these lines, he has found that simply talking through your problems in the third person (<a href=\"http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/obsonline/need-to-solve-a-personal-problem-try-a-third-person-perspective.html\">&ldquo;he&rdquo; or &ldquo;she&rdquo;, rather than &ldquo;I</a>&rdquo;) helps create the necessary emotional distance, reducing your prejudices and leading to wiser arguments. Hopefully, more research will suggest many similar tricks.</p><p>The challenge will be getting people to admit their own foibles. If you&rsquo;ve been able to rest on the laurels of your intelligence all your life, it could be very hard to accept that it has been blinding your judgement. As Socrates had it: the wisest person really may be the one who can admit he knows nothing.</p><p><em>Share this story on&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</p><p></em><strong>Read more:</p><p></strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150213-the-downsides-of-being-beautiful\">{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jxghm\"}}</a></p><p><em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150213-the-downsides-of-being-beautiful\">The surprising downsides of being drop dead gorgeous</a></em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-14T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The surprising downsides of being clever ","HeadlineShort":"The downsides of being clever","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Can high intelligence be a burden rather than a boon?

Aristotle and his followers even compiled a volume of the ways that your looks could reflect your spirit.</p><p>\"Soft hair indicates cowardice and coarse hair courage,\" they wrote. Impudence, the treatise says, was evident in \"bright, wise-open eyes with heavy blood-shot lids\"; a broad nose, meanwhile, was a sign of laziness, like in cattle.</p><p>Sensuous, fleshy lips fared little better. The philosophers saw it as a sign of folly, \"like an ass\", while those with especially thin mouths were thought to be proud, like lions.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lttmf\"}}</p><p>Today, we are taught not to judge a book by its cover. But while it is wise not to set too much by appearances, psychologists are finding that your face offers a window on our deepest secrets. Even if you keep a stony poker face, your features can reveal details about your personality, your health, and your intelligence.</p><p><strong>Assertive structure</strong></p><p>&ldquo;The idea is that our biology, like genes and hormone levels, influences our growth, and the same mechanisms will also shape our character,&rdquo; explains <a href=\"http://clefevre.moonfruit.com/home/4562134246\">Carmen Lefevre at Northumbria University</a>.</p><p>Consider the face&rsquo;s bone structure &ndash; whether it is relatively short and wide or long and thin. Lefevre has found that people with <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090513813000275\">higher levels of testosterone</a> tend to be wider-faced with bigger cheekbones, and they are also more likely to have more assertive, and sometimes aggressive, personalities.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lttch\"}}</p><p>The link between face shape and dominance is surprisingly widespread, from <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0093369\">capuchin monkeys</a> &ndash; the wider the face, the more likely they are to hold a higher rank in the group&rsquo;s hierarchy &ndash; to professional football players. Examining the 2010 World Cup, Keith Welker at the University of Boulder, Colorado, recently showed that the ratio of the width and height of the footballers&rsquo; faces predicted both the number of fouls among midfielders, and the number of goals scored by the forwards.</p><p>(To calculate this yourself, compare the distance from ear-to-ear with the distance between the top of your eyes, and your upper lip. The average ratio of width-to-height&nbsp; is around 2 &ndash; Abraham Lincoln was 1.93)</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ltvbc\"}}</p><p>It may even clue you in to a politician&rsquo;s motives. Using volunteers to rate former US presidents on different psychological attributes, Lefevre found that face shape seemed to reflect their perceived ambition and drive. <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886912000049\">John F Kennedy had a thicker-set face than 19th Century Chester Arthur</a>, for instance. Such analyses of historical figures are perhaps best taken with a pinch of salt, however, and it has to be said that other traits, such as cooperation and intelligence, should be equally important for success.</p><p><strong>Plump cheeks</strong></p><p>As you might expect, your health and medical history are also written in your countenance &ndash; and the detail it offers is surprising. The amount of fat on your face, for instance, provides a stronger indication of your fitness than more standard measures, such as your body mass index. Those with thinner faces are less likely to suffer infections, and when they do, the illness is less severe; they also tend to have lower rates of depression and anxiety, probably because mental health is often closely related to the body&rsquo;s fitness in general.</p><p>How could the plumpness of your cheeks say so much about you? Benedict Jones at the University of Glasgow thinks a new understanding of fat&rsquo;s role in the body may help explain it. &ldquo;How healthy you are isn&rsquo;t so much about how much fat you have, but where you have that fat,&rdquo; he says. Pear-shaped people, with more weight around the hips and bottom but slimmer torsos, tend to be healthier than &ldquo;apples&rdquo; with a spare tyre around the midriff, since the adipose tissue around the chest is thought to release inflammatory molecules that can damage the core organs. Perhaps the fullness of your face reflects the fatty deposits in the more harmful areas, Jones says. Or it could be that facial fat is itself dangerous for some reason.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02lttwg\"}}</p><p>Besides these more overt cues, very subtle differences in skin colour can also reveal your health secrets. Jones and Lefevre emphasise this has nothing to do with the tones associated with ethnicity, but barely-noticeable tints that may reflect differences in lifestyle. You appear to be in more robust health, for instance, if your skin has a slightly yellowish, golden tone. The pigments in question are called carotenoids, which, as the name suggest, can be found in orange and red fruit and veg. Carotenoids help build a healthy immune system, says Lefevre. &ldquo;But when we&rsquo;ve eaten enough, they layer in the skin and dye it yellow. We exhibit them, because we haven&rsquo;t used them to battle illness.&rdquo; The glow of health, in turn, contributes significantly to your physical attraction &ndash; more so, in fact, than the <a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17470218.2014.944194?journalCode=pqje20#preview\">more overt tones that might accompany a trip to the tanning salon</a>.</p><p>A blush of pink, meanwhile, should signal the good circulation that comes with an active lifestyle &ndash; and it might also be a sign of a woman&rsquo;s fertility. Jones has found that women tend to adopt a slightly redder flush at the peak of the menstrual cycle, <a href=\"http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/103607/\">perhaps because estradiol</a>, a sex hormone, leads the blood vessels in the cheek to dilate slightly. It may be one of many tiny shifts in appearance and behaviour that together make a woman <a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/25457-fertile-women-attractiveness.html\">slightly more attractive when she is most likely to conceive</a>.</p><p><strong>Looking smart</strong></p><p>As Jones points out, these secrets were hiding in plain sight &ndash; yet we were slow to uncover them. At the very least, this knowledge helps restore the reputation of &ldquo;physiognomy&rdquo;, which has suffered a somewhat chequered reputation since Aristotle&rsquo;s musings. Tudor king Henry VIII was so sceptical of the idea that he even banned quack &ldquo;professors&rdquo; from <a href=\"https://books.google.com/books?id=9P0ZAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA330&amp;lpg=PA330&amp;dq=henry+8+physiognomy+beggars&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=V6GbryaHDX&amp;sig=_VrckPgiNE8ZIzJgNh1oCLkkG_A&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=BAj_VNbYJ4ixggT2r4OoCQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=henry%208%20physiognomy%20beggars&amp;f=false\">profiting from their readings,</a> and its status took a second bashing in the early 20th Century, when it was associated with phrenology &ndash; the mistaken idea that lumps and bumps on your head can predict your behaviour.</p><p>But now the discipline is gaining credibility, we may find that there are many more surprises hiding in your selfies. Intriguingly, we seem to be able to predict intelligence from someone&rsquo;s face with modest accuracy &ndash; though it&rsquo;s not yet clear what <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0081237\">specific cues make someone look smart</a>. (Needless to say, it is not as simple as whether or not they wear glasses.) Others are examining the &ldquo;gaydar&rdquo;. We often can guess someone&rsquo;s sexual orientation within a split-second, <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0036671\">even when there are no stereotypical clues</a>, but it&rsquo;s still a mystery as to what we&rsquo;re actually reading. Further research might explain exactly how we make these snap judgements.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ltv17\"}}</p><p>It will also be interesting to see how the link between personality, lifestyle and appearance changes across the lifetime. One study managed to examine records of personality and appearance, following subjects from the 1930s to the 1990s. The scientists found that although baby-faced men tended to be less dominant in their youth, they grew to be more assertive as the years wore on &ndash; perhaps because they learnt to compensate for the expectations brought about by their puppyish appearance.</p><p>More intriguingly, the authors also found evidence of a &ldquo;<a href=\"http://psp.sagepub.com/content/24/7/736.abstract\">Dorian Gray effect</a>&rdquo; &ndash; where the ageing face began to reflect certain aspects of the personality that hadn&rsquo;t been obvious when the people were younger. Women who had more attractive, sociable, personalities from adolescence to their 30s slowly started to climb in physical attractiveness, so that in their 50s they were considered better-looking than those who had been less personable but naturally prettier. One possibility is that they simply knew how to make the best of their appearance, and that their inner confidence was reflected on subtle differences in expression.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ltv4m\"}}</p><p>After all, there is so much more to our appearance than the bone structure and skin tone, as one particularly clever study recently demonstrated. The scientists asked volunteers to wear their favourite clothes, and then took a photo of their face. Even though the clothes themselves were not visible in the mugshots, impartial judges considered them to be considerably more attractive than other pictures of the participants. The finding is particularly striking, considering that they were asked to keep neutral expressions: somehow, the <a href=\"http://www.gu.se/english/research/publication/?publicationId=101305\">boosted self-esteem shone through</a> anyway.</p><p>Our faces aren&rsquo;t just the product of our biology.

Well, she would have been the paintbrush.&rdquo;</p><p>French may have been talking in jest, but her point is a serious one. Do standards of beauty change over time? Or are some features universally accepted, across the centuries and across cultures, as being universally appealing?</p><blockquote><p> Has our notion of beauty always been the same? </p></blockquote><p>There are even some good evolutionary reasons why beauty might be timeless. Certain biological features might signal health, fitness, and fertility &ndash; the makings of good mate &ndash; and we should find these features sexually attractive. Yet the more biologists and psychologists have looked, the harder it has been to find a purely biological basis for beauty.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vc8sj\"}}</p><p>Consider the apparently received wisdom that we prefer symmetrical, evenly balanced features. The scientific explanation seems sound: disease and stress during childhood could subtly influence the body&rsquo;s development, creating an &ldquo;instability&rdquo; that leads one side to grow slightly differently to the other. A slightly lopsided face should therefore be a sign of physical weakness &ndash; making them less appealing as the parent of your children.</p><p>The problem had been that many of the previous experiments had asked just a small number of subjects to rate different faces &ndash; making it easier for fluke results to jump out. When Stefan Van Dongen at the University of Antwerp conflated the results in a large meta-analysis, <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.3109/03014460.2010.544676\">he found the effect almost disappears</a> when you consider enough people. In fact, facial symmetry may not even say much about your health. Although previous research had found some evidence for the idea, a 2014 study took 3D scans of nearly 5,000 teenagers and quizzed them about their medical history. It found that those with the most <a href=\"http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/d-brief/2014/08/12/facial-symmetry-attractive-not-because-indicates-health/#.VYfUZxCtaFE\">symmetrical features had been no fitter than the others</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vc9lx\"}}</p><p>Biologists had also hypothesised that we prefer faces that epitomise the &lsquo;manliness&rsquo; or &lsquo;femininity&rsquo; of their gender: the broad jaw of Jon Hamm for men; the delicate features of Miranda Kerr for women. Again, the rationale was sound: bone structure reflects the sex hormones pumping through our blood, so they could advertise a woman&rsquo;s fertility and traits like dominance in men &ndash; important considerations when picking a partner.</p><blockquote><p> In some places, feminine-looking men rule over their masculine counterparts </p></blockquote><p>Yet most studies had only examined Western societies. When Isabel Scott at Brunel University, and colleagues, decided to cast their net wider &ndash; across communities in Asia, Africa, South America and Russia, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4210032/#r4\">they found a variety of preferences</a>. In fact, it was only in the most urbanised regions that they found the strong attraction to more masculine men and more feminine women; in the smaller, more remote communities, many women actually preferred the more &ldquo;feminine&rdquo; looking men.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vc9gb\"}}</p><p>The same goes for body shape. In the West, people may prize longer legs in women while preferring less &ldquo;lanky men&rdquo;, yet <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22558830\">the nomadic Himba society in Namibia have the opposite tastes</a>. Even Western preferences seem to have shifted over time; Botticelli&rsquo;s Venus &ndash; once the Western ideal of beauty &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.perceptionweb.com/abstract.cgi?id=p6621\">has shorter legs, compared to her body, than the desired shape for models today</a>.) And although an hourglass figure in women, and men with broad, V-shaped shoulders tapering at the waist, are admired in most places, the ideal extremes depend on the society.</p><blockquote><p> Where starvation is a risk, heavier weight is more attractive </p></blockquote><p>Perhaps our choice of mate needs to be flexible, so we can choose the best partner based on our current circumstances. &ldquo;For example, in cultures where starvation is a real risk, preferences for heavier weight in partners is expected because those individuals are most resistant to food shortages,&rdquo; says <a href=\"http://www.alittlelab.com\">Anthony Little</a> at the University of Stirling &ndash; and indeed, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4141791/\">this does seem to be the case</a>. By the same token, someone who faces higher risk of illness will be more primed to value the signs that signal good health &ndash; like facial symmetry &ndash; compared to those who are relatively safe from infection. When dominance is valued, meanwhile, women may also prefer men with squarer chins &ndash; and higher testosterone. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve found, for example, that exposure to cues of male-male competition, such as seeing men fight each other, increases women&rsquo;s preferences for masculine male faces,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vc8yd\"}}</p><p>So although our concepts of beauty may seem ethereal and timeless, they may just be the direct product of our immediate circumstances. It&rsquo;s also worth noting the effect of conformity: study after study has found that if you hear or see that someone else is attracted to someone, you are more likely to fancy them yourself. In this way, tastes for certain types of people could spread throughout a population, shaping our norms for what we consider beautiful. &ldquo;The benefit of this is that you don't have to learn everything for yourself and can benefit from the experience of others,&rdquo; Little says. &ldquo;What is interesting in modern society is that social media can mean this learning could be on a worldwide scale.&rdquo;</p><blockquote><p> If somebody else dubs you attractive, the perception can be contagious </p></blockquote><p>Consider this recent experiment from Johns Hopkins Carey Business School in Baltimore. The researchers used a dating website that allowed users to rate random people. After they had made up their mind, some users were shown the average score from other visitors. Although there was no &ldquo;right&rdquo; or &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; answers, the users soon learnt which types were proving more popular, and started to score other faces along similar lines. Soon, everyone&rsquo;s taste had converged &ndash; their concept of beauty had shifted, just by using the website. This is despite the fact that it was completely anonymous &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference-proceedings.aspx?Id=1017500\">there was no benefit to going with the status quo</a>.</p><p>It is easy to imagine how this kind of herd behaviour has benefited certain celebrities. On a smaller scale, you can achieve similar effects simply by being seen with people who you could potentially couple off with, such as members of the opposite sex. Others will assume that you are already a hit, and follow suit.</p><p>Our attraction is also shaped by familiarity: the more people see you with a certain appearance, the more attractive it can appear. In a time when cosmetic surgery is becoming the norm, this offers an important lesson. Instead of changing your unusual looks to suit the fashions of the time, you could instead use your looks to change the fashion.</p><p><em>Follow us on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>,</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em><strong>Google+</strong></em></a>&nbsp;<em>or</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-06-23T19:47:23Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"The myth of universal beauty","HeadlineShort":"Would you be beautiful in the past?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Would you have been beautiful in another era?

He had gym in the morning, where he played volleyball for 45 minutes. He then entered his office to clear a backlog of emails, before heading to the dentist&rsquo;s for root-canal surgery.</p><p>&ldquo;I remember getting into the chair and the dentist inserting the local anaesthetic,&rdquo; he tells me. After that? A complete blank.</p><blockquote><p> It is as if all new memories are being written in invisible ink that slowly disappears. </p></blockquote><p>Since then, he has been unable to remember almost anything for longer than 90 minutes. So while he can still tell me about the first time he met the Duke of York for a briefing at the Ministry of Defence, he can&rsquo;t even remember where he&rsquo;s living now; he wakes up every morning believing he is still in Germany in 2005, waiting to visit the dentist. Without a record of new experiences, the passing of time means nothing to him. Today, he only knows that there is a problem because he and his wife have written detailed notes on his smartphone, in a file labelled &ldquo;First thing &ndash; read this&rdquo;.</p><p>It is as if all new memories are being written in invisible ink that slowly disappears. How could minor dental work have affected his brain in such a profound way? This real-life medical mystery offers a rare glimpse at the hidden depths of the brain&rsquo;s workings.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzr8k\"}}</p><p>Even the events leading up to William&rsquo;s amnesia are highly puzzling. At the time of the surgery, the dentist didn&rsquo;t realise that anything was wrong; it was only after they asked him to take off his protective dark glasses that they saw he was pale, and struggled to stand up. They called his wife. &ldquo;He was lying on a couch,&rdquo; Samantha recalls. (Both their names have been altered to preserve the family's privacy). &ldquo;His eyes were staring; he looked surprised to see me &ndash; he had no clue what was going on.&rdquo; By 5pm he was removed to hospital, where he stayed for three days. Even after some of the mental fog dissipated, he was still unable to recall anything for more than a few minutes.</p><p>The doctors initially suspected that he&rsquo;d reacted badly to the anaesthetic, causing a brain haemorrhage &ndash; yet they failed to find evidence of injury. So he was discharged with the mystery still hanging over him, and the family moved back to England, where he was referred to the office of <a href=\"http://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/psychology/ppl/gb222\">Gerald Burgess</a>, a clinical psychologist in Leicester.</p><p><strong>The brain&rsquo;s printing press</strong></p><p>The obvious explanation would have been that William had a form of &ldquo;anterograde amnesia&rdquo;, like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Molaison\">Henry Molaison</a>, whose experiences have informed much of what we know about memory. During brain surgery to treat his epilepsy, surgeons sliced out a large chunk of Molaison&rsquo;s grey matter, including his hippocampi &ndash; seahorse-shaped regions at the centre of the brain. They act as our memory&rsquo;s printing press, stamping the &ldquo;episodic memories&rdquo; of events into long-term storage &ndash; and without them, Molaison was unable to hold on to anything that occurred after the surgery.</p><blockquote><p> William could work out how to solve a complex maze, only to completely forget the skill three days later. </p></blockquote><p>Yet as William&rsquo;s first doctors had noted, brain scans seemed to show that these crucial areas were still intact. Nor did his symptoms exactly match those of other anterograde amnesiacs. While Molaison couldn&rsquo;t remember details of personal events, for instance, he could learn new &ldquo;procedural&rdquo; skills since they are processed in different parts of the brain. When Burgess asked William to work out how to solve a complex maze, however, he had completely forgotten the skill three days later. &ldquo;It was like a d&eacute;j&agrave; vu replica of the same errors &ndash; he took the same time to relearn the task once more,&rdquo; says Burgess.</p><p>One possibility is that William&rsquo;s amnesia is a &ldquo;psychogenic illness&rdquo;. Some patients report memory loss after a traumatic event &ndash; but that tends to be a coping mechanism to avoid thinking about painful past events; it doesn&rsquo;t normally affect your ability to remember the present. Samantha says that William had suffered no trauma, and according to Burgess&rsquo;s detailed psychiatric assessments, he is otherwise emotionally healthy. &ldquo;He was a successful father and military officer with good job evaluations,&rdquo; says Burgess. &ldquo;There was no reason to think that there was anything wrong psychiatrically.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzqmd\"}}</p><p>Given the evidence, Burgess instead suspects the answer may be hiding in the thicket of tiny neural connections we call &ldquo;synapses&rdquo;. Once we have experienced an event, the memories are slowly cemented in the long term by altering these richly woven networks. That process of &ldquo;consolidation&rdquo; involves the production of new proteins to rebuild the synapses in their new shape; without it, the memory remains fragile and is easily eroded with time. Block that protein synthesis in rats, and they soon forget anything they have just learnt. Crucially, 90 minutes would be about the right time for this consolidation to take place &ndash; just as William starts to forget the details of the event. Rather than losing its printing press, like Molaison, William's brain seems to have simply run out of ink.</p><p>Even so, it&rsquo;s not clear why root canal surgery should have made his brain run dry in this way. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the million-pound question&rdquo;, says Burgess, &ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t have an answer.&rdquo; Scouring the medical literature, he found five similar cases of mysterious memory loss without brain damage. Although none occurred during a trip to the dentist, they do seem to follow other periods of physiological stress during a medical emergency. &ldquo;It could be a genetic predisposition that needs a catalyst event to start the process,&rdquo; says Burgess.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzrck\"}}</p><p>Burgess hopes that his new paper, <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25978125\">which appears in Neurocase journal</a>, will encourage other psychologists to share similar stories and perhaps spark other theories. They are already intrigued. &ldquo;It is a bit of a head scratcher,&rdquo; admits <a href=\"http://psych.cf.ac.uk/contactsandpeople/academics/aggleton.php\">John Aggleton, at Cardiff University</a> in the UK. He would like to see more detailed tests, looking more specifically at the long-distance connectivity of the brain. Even if there&rsquo;s no damage to the brain cells themselves, William may be missing some of the necessary wiring around the hippocampi and other parts of the memory processing pipeline, he thinks.</p><p>For the time being, William helps to remind us just how little we know about our own minds. Mesmerised by colourful MRI scans, many now think of the brain as a kind of computer, with separate chips devoted &ldquo;memory&rdquo;, &ldquo;fear&rdquo; or &ldquo;sex&rdquo;. &nbsp;Yet William perfectly demonstrates why this modular view of the mind is over-simplistic. Even when all that machinery is apparently intact, you can still find yourself lost in the present, with no way of bridging the past and the future. Clearly, the brain has many more layers to be peeled away before we can get to the heart of what makes us who we are.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02vzqdm\"}}</p><blockquote><p> In the last 10 years, William has been able to cling to one new fact &ndash; his father&rsquo;s death. </p></blockquote><p>William also demonstrates just how the powerfully our emotions shape our minds. In the last 10 years, he has been able to cling to one new fact &ndash; his father&rsquo;s death. Somehow, the force of his grief helped him to forge new tracks in the brain and grasp on to that fact, when everything else has slipped away. Even then, he is unable to remember the events surrounding it, nor the bedside vigil in his last few days.</p><p>When I speak to him, he has just relearnt &ndash; for the thousandth time &ndash; that his daughter and son are now 21 and 18, not the young children he remembers. He hopes the rest of their lives will not be lost to him. &ldquo;I want to walk my daughter down the aisle and remember it. Should they become parents, I would like to remember that I have grandchildren, and who they are.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\">Google+</a> or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-07-01T15:01:42Z","Geolocation":null,"HeadlineLong":"‘My dentist saved my tooth, but wiped my memory’","HeadlineShort":"‘My dentist extracted my memory’","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"After simple dental surgery, William lost his ability to form new memories.

Most people would like to assume that they are free agents &ndash; their fate lies in their own hands. But they&rsquo;d be wrong. Often, we are as helpless as a marionette, being jerked about by someone else&rsquo;s subtle influence. Without even feeling the tug, we do their bidding &ndash; while believing that it was our idea all along.</p><p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re finding more and more in psychology is that lots of the decisions we make are influenced by things we are not aware of,&rdquo; says Jay Olson at McGill University in Quebec, Canada &ndash; who recently created an ingenious experiment showing just how easily we are manipulated by the gentlest persuasion. The question is, can we learn to spot those tricks, and how can we use them to our own advantage?</p><p>Olson has spent a lifetime exploring the subtle ways of tricking people&rsquo;s perception, and it all began with magic. &ldquo;I started magic tricks when I was five and performing when I was seven,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>As an undergraduate in psychology, he found the new understanding of the mind often chimed with the skills he had learnt with his hobby. &ldquo;Lots of what they said about attention and memory were just what magicians had been saying in a different way,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>One card trick, in particular, captured his imagination as he set about his research. It involved flicking through a deck in front of an audience member, who is asked to pick a card randomly. Unknown to the volunteer, he already worked out which card they would choose, allowing him to reach into his pocket and pluck the exact card they had named &ndash; much to the astonishment of the crowd.</p><p>You can see a video of Olson blowing his volunteers&rsquo; minds below:</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"McGill-researchers-show-how-mag\"}}</p><p>The secret, apparently, is to linger on your chosen card as you riffle through the deck. (In our conversation, Olson wouldn&rsquo;t divulge how he engineers that to happen, but others claim that <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058254\">folding the card very slightly</a> seems to cause it to stick in sight.) Those few extra milliseconds mean that it sticks in the mind, causing the volunteer to pick it when they are pushed for a choice.<br /> &nbsp;<br /> As a scientist, Olson&rsquo;s first task was to formally test his success rate. He already knew he was pretty effective, but the results were truly staggering &ndash; Olson managed to direct 103 out of 105 of the participants.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, that alone <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/02/this-is-your-brain-on-magic/385468/\">has attracted a fair amount of media attention</a> &ndash; but it was the next part of the study that was most surprising to Olson, since it shows us just how easily our mind is manipulated.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mnpv0\"}}</p><p>For instance, when he questioned the volunteers afterwards, he was shocked to find that 92% of the volunteers had absolutely no idea that they&rsquo;d been manipulated and felt that they had been in complete control of their decisions. Even more surprisingly, a large proportion went as far as to make up imaginary reasons for their choice. &ldquo;One person said &lsquo;I chose the 10 of hearts because 10 is high number and I was thinking of hearts before the experiment started&rsquo;,&rdquo; says Olson &ndash; despite the fact that it was really Olson who&rsquo;d made the decision. What&rsquo;s more, Olson found that things like personality type didn&rsquo;t seem to have much influence on how likely someone was to be influenced &ndash; we all seem equally vulnerable. Nor did the specific properties of the cards &ndash; the colour or number &ndash; seem to make success any less likely.</p><p>The implications extend far beyond the magician&rsquo;s stage, and should cause us to reconsider our perceptions of personal will. Despite a strong sense of freedom, our ability to make deliberate decisions may often be an illusion. &ldquo;Having a free choice is just a feeling &ndash; it isn&rsquo;t linked with the decision itself,&rdquo; says Olson.</p><p><strong>Subtle menu</strong></p><p>Don&rsquo;t believe him? Consider when you go to a restaurant for a meal. Olson says you are twice as likely to choose from the very top or very bottom of the menu &ndash; because those areas first attract your eye. &ldquo;But if someone asks you why did you choose the salmon, you&rsquo;ll say you were hungry for salmon,&rdquo; says Olson. &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t say it was one of the first things I looked at on the menu.&rdquo; In other words, we confabulate to explain our choice, despite the fact it had already been primed by the restaurant.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mnprn\"}}</p><p>Or how about the simple task of choosing wine at the supermarket? Jennifer McKendrick and colleagues at the University of Leicester found that simply playing <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/apl/84/2/271/\">French or German background music</a> led people to buy wines from those regions. When asked, however, the subjects were completely oblivious to the fact.</p><p>It is less clear how this might relate to other forms of priming, a subject of <a href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sold/201406/subliminal-ads-unconscious-influence-and-consumption\">long controversy</a>. In the 2000 US election, for instance, Al Gore supporters claimed the Republicans had flashed the word &ldquo;RATS&rdquo; in an advert depicting the Democrat representative.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Bush-Campaign-Rats-Subliminal-M\"}}</p><p>Gore&rsquo;s supporters believed the (alleged) subliminal message about their candidate would sway voters. <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9221.2008.00658.x/full\">Replicating the ad with a made-up candidate</a>, Drew Westen at Emory University, found that the flash of the word really did damage the politician&rsquo;s ratings, according to subjects in the lab. Whether the strategy could have ever swayed the results of an election in the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30878843\">long term is debatable</a> (similarly, the supposed success of <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-30878843\">subliminal advertising</a> is disputed) but it seems likely that other kinds of priming do have some effect on behaviour without you realising it.</p><p>In one striking result, simply seeing a photo of an <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597809000028\">athlete winning a race significantly boosted telephone sales reps&rsquo; performance</a> &ndash; despite the fact that most people couldn&rsquo;t even remember seeing the picture. And there is some evidence showing that handing someone a hot drink can make you seem like a &ldquo;warmer&rdquo; person, or <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528731.800-the-yuck-factor-the-surprising-power-of-disgust.html\">smelling a nasty odour can make you more morally &ldquo;disgusted&rdquo;</a> and cause you to judge people more harshly.</p><p><strong>How to spot manipulation</strong></p><p>Clearly, this kind of knowledge could be used for coercion in the wrong hands, so it&rsquo;s worth knowing how to spot others trying to bend you to their will without you realising.</p><p>Based on the scientific literature, here are four manipulative moves to watch out in your colleagues and friends in everyday life:</p><p>1) <strong>A touch can be powerful</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mnwxk\"}}</p><p>Simply tapping someone on the shoulder, and looking them in the eye, means they are far more open to suggestion.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a technique Olson uses during his trick, but it also has been shown to work in various everyday situations &ndash; such as <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022103177900440\">persuading people to lend money</a>.<strong></p><p></strong>2) <strong>The speed of</strong> <strong>speech matters</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mnwnx\"}}</p><p>Olson says that magicians will often try to rush their volunteers so they choose the first thing that comes to mind &ndash; hopefully the idea that you planted there. But once they have made their choice, they switch to a more relaxed manner.</p><p>The volunteer will look back and think they had been free to make up their mind in their own time.</p><p>3) <strong>Be aware of the field-of-view</strong></p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mntz9\"}}</p><p>By lingering on his chosen card, Olson made it more &ldquo;salient&rdquo; so it stuck in the volunteers&rsquo; minds without them even realising it.</p><p>There are many ways that can done, from placing something at eye level, to moving something slightly closer to a target.

Like a witch doctor&rsquo;s spell, their words might be spreading modern plagues.</p><blockquote><p>It&rsquo;s a consistent phenomenon, but medicine has never really dealt with it</p></blockquote><p>We have long known that expectations of a malady can be as dangerous as a virus. In the same way that voodoo shamans could harm their victims through the power of suggestion, priming someone to think they are ill can often produce the actual symptoms of a disease. Vomiting, dizziness, headaches, and even death, could be triggered through belief alone. It&rsquo;s called the &ldquo;nocebo effect&rdquo;.</p><p>But it is now becoming clear just how easily those dangerous beliefs can spread through gossip and hearsay &ndash; with potent effect. It may be the reason why certain houses seem cursed with illness, and why people living near wind turbines report puzzling outbreaks of <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wind-turbine-syndrome-blamed-mysterious-symptoms-cape-cod/story?id=20591168\">dizziness, insomnia and vomiting</a>. If you have ever felt &ldquo;fluey&rdquo; after a vaccination, <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/mar/29/electrosensitivity-is-technology-killing-us\">believed your cell phone was giving you a headache</a>, or suffered an inexplicable food allergy, you may have also fallen victim to a nocebo jinx. &ldquo;The nocebo effect shows the brain&rsquo;s power,&rdquo; says Dimos Mitsikostas, from Athens Naval Hospital in Greece. &ldquo;And we cannot fully explain it.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>A killer joke</strong></p><p>Doctors have long known that beliefs can be deadly &ndash; as demonstrated by a rather nasty student prank that went horribly wrong. The 18th Century Viennese medic, Erich Menninger von Lerchenthal, describes how students at his medical school picked on a much-disliked assistant. Planning to teach him a lesson, they sprung upon him before announcing that he was about to be decapitated. Blindfolding him, they bowed his head onto the chopping block, before dropping a wet cloth on his neck. Convinced it was the kiss of a steel blade, the poor man &ldquo;<a href=\"http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0091743597902280/1-s2.0-S0091743597902280-main.pdf?_tid=629508a2-ad24-11e4-91aa-00000aab0f01&amp;acdnat=1423133431_417644834766d9ed139dcb89374277fb\">died on the spot</a>&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrtf\"}}</p><p>While anecdotes like this abound, modern researchers had mostly focused on the mind&rsquo;s ability to heal, not harm &ndash; the &ldquo;placebo effect&rdquo;, from the Latin for &ldquo;I will please&rdquo;. Every clinical trial now randomly assigns patients to either a real drug, or a placebo in the form of an inert pill. The patient doesn&rsquo;t know which they are taking, and even those taking the inert drug tend to show some improvement &ndash; thanks to their faith in the treatment.</p><p>Yet alongside the benefits, people taking placebos often report puzzling side effects &ndash; nausea, headaches, or pain &ndash; that are unlikely to come from an inert tablet. The problem is that people in a clinical trial are given exactly the same health warnings whether they are taking the real drug or the placebo &ndash; and somehow, the expectation of the symptoms can produce physical manifestations in some placebo takers. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a consistent phenomenon, but medicine has never really dealt with it,&rdquo; says Ted Kaptchuk at Harvard Medical School.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqryx\"}}</p><p>Over the last 10 years, doctors have shown that this nocebo effect &ndash; Latin for &ldquo;I will harm&rdquo; &ndash; is very common. Reviewing the literature, Mitsikostas has so far documented strong nocebo effects in many treatments for headache, multiple sclerosis, and depression. In <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23145482\">trials for Parkinson&rsquo;s disease</a>, as many as 65% report adverse events as a result of their placebo. &ldquo;And around one out of 10 treated will drop out of a trial because of nocebo, which is pretty high,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Although many of the side-effects are somewhat subjective &ndash; like nausea or pain &ndash; nocebo responses do occasionally show up as rashes and skin complaints, and they are sometimes detectable on physiological tests too. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unbelievable &ndash; they are taking sugar pills and when you measure liver enzymes, they are elevated,&rdquo; says Mitsikostas.</p><p>And for those who think these side effects are somehow &ldquo;deliberately&rdquo; willed or imagined, measures of nerve activity following nocebo treatment have shown that the spinal cord begins <a href=\"http://www.jneurosci.org/content/33/34/13784.long\">responding to heightened pain</a> before conscious deliberation would even be possible.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs10\"}}</p><p>Consider the near fatal case of &ldquo;Mr A&rdquo;, reported by doctor Roy Reeves in 2007. Mr A was suffering from depression when he consumed a whole bottle of pills. Regretting his decision, Mr A rushed to ER, and promptly collapsed at reception. It looked serious; his blood pressure had plummeted, and he was hyperventilating; he was immediately given intravenous fluids. Yet blood tests could find no trace of the drug in his system. Four hours later, another doctor arrived to inform Reeves that the man had been in the placebo arm of a drugs trial; <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0163834307000114\">he had &ldquo;overdosed&rdquo; on sugar tablets</a>. Upon hearing the news, the relieved Mr A soon recovered.</p><p>We can never know whether the nocebo effect would have actually killed Mr A, though Fabrizio Benedetti at the University of Turin Medical School thinks it is certainly possible. He has scanned subjects&rsquo; brains as they undergo nocebo suggestions, which seems to set off a chain of activation in the hypothalamus, and the pituitary and adrenal glands &ndash; areas that deal with extreme threats to our body. If your fear and belief were strong enough, the resulting cocktail of hormones could be deadly, he says.</p><p><strong>Sick rumours</p><p></strong>The thought that your doctor could inadvertently make you sicker is concerning enough. But more recently, it has become clear just how little is needed to spread the nocebo effect. Even just passing gossip and hearsay can prime your mind for illness with potent effect.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs30\"}}</p><p>Last year, for instance, Benedetti offered to take <a href=\"http://hcpportalco20140430.pfizer.edrupalgardens.com/sites/g/files/g10013506/f/publicaciones/2014_155_5_Nocebo-and-placebo-modulation-of-hypobaric-hypoxia-headache-involves-the-cyclooxygenase-prostaglandins-pathway.pdf\">more than 100 students up the Italian Alps</a> to an altitude of 3000m (9800ft). A few days beforehand, he had told just one of them about a possible consequence &ndash; that the thin air could bring on a migraine. By the day of the trip, he found that the gossip had spread to more than a quarter of the group &ndash; and those who had heard the rumour began to suffer the worst headaches. What&rsquo;s more, a study of their saliva showed an exaggerated response to the low oxygen conditions, including a proliferation of the enzymes that are associated with altitude headache. &ldquo;The brain biochemistry changed in the &lsquo;socially infected&rsquo; individuals,&rdquo; says Benedetti.</p><p>In other words, harmful beliefs, that transmit illness, could be catching. &ldquo;Negative expectations can be communicated to your friends, neighbours, and the like, and they spread very quickly, producing social nocebo effects in a large population of subjects,&rdquo; says Benedetti. Indeed, another study found that simply seeing another patient suffering pain can <a href=\"http://www.pfizerpro.com.co/sites/g/files/g10013506/f/publicaciones/08013%20V154I8-Responding-to-nocebos-through-observation-Social-contagion-of-negative-emotions_1165_1165.pdf\">make a treatment hurt more</a> &ndash; suggesting nocebo could pass from person to person by silent observation. Even more worryingly, you might not need to be <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/39/15959.short\">conscious of those thoughts to be affected</a>; the nocebo can apparently be triggered by subliminal cues.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqs5m\"}}</p><p>History is full of mysterious outbreaks that might have arisen in this way. Most famous is the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dancing_Plague_of_1518\">deadly dancing plague of 1518</a>. Then, in the 1960s, there was the mysterious &ldquo;June Bug&rdquo; epidemic in an American textile factory, which brought about dizziness and vomiting, despite the fact that none of the poisonous insects thought to be responsible could ever be identified. The most chilling was the spate of mysterious deaths within the community of Hmong people who arrived in the US from southeast Asia in the 1980s &ndash; young men, with no existing illness, <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2011/09/the-dark-side-of-the-placebo-effect-when-intense-belief-kills/245065/\">who began dying in their sleep after periods of nightmares and sleep paralysis</a>; experts have speculated that it arose from a strong cultural belief in deadly night spirits. Often, fear of new technology seems to be responsible: in the late 19th Century, early telephone users reported giddiness and wracking pain after using the new contraption, for instance, while Scandinavian workers in the 1980s developed surprising rashes, apparently from their computer monitors.</p><p>Today, the nocebo is perhaps most visible in such controversial disorders as &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.noiseandhealth.org/article.asp?issn=1463-1741;year=2014;volume=16;issue=69;spage=116;epage=122;aulast=Rubin\">wind turbine syndrome</a>&rdquo; (sickness and insomnia from wind farms, most common in Canada) and &ldquo;electro-sensitivity&rdquo; &ndash; an allergic reaction to mobile phone signals and wi-fi. Some sufferers even resort to sleeping in metal cocoons to avoid the constant ringing in their ears. Yet dozens of experiments have shown that people are just as likely to report the same symptoms when they are exposed to a sham transmitter that doesn&rsquo;t actually emit any electromagnetic waves.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrx1\"}}</p><p>If work on the nocebo tells us anything, it is that we shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the distress of their condition. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got no doubt in my mind &ndash; people are genuinely experiencing physical symptoms,&rdquo; says James Rubin at King&rsquo;s College London. Even the former head of the World Health Organisation was affected: she <a href=\"http://microwavenews.com/short-takes-archive/brundtland-now-using-cell-phone\">banned cell phones in her office</a>, because she thought that they gave her splitting headaches.</p><p>Fears of electro-sensitivity are relatively rare, but there are many other ways a nocebo belief could have taken a hold of your health. Perhaps you suffer from a mysterious food intolerance, for instance. In England, 20% of people claim to be unable to stomach certain foods &ndash; yet hospital tests of the actual digestion suggest that only about a tenth of that number of people have a real problem. The nocebo may also explain why people apparently develop sickness after an inert vaccine, and it may shed light on <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001078241000363X\">the oft-discussed side-effects of the contraceptive pill</a> &ndash; such as depression, headache, and breast pain&ndash; which scientific trails have mostly failed to confirm. Expectation of illness may also lie behind the sickness and <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4118898/\">eye-strain apparently created by 3D TVs</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02jqrxt\"}}</p><p>What can be done? It is notoriously difficult to neutralise long-held beliefs, but responsible media reporting would at least stem the spread of poisonous rumours. In 2013, Rubin found that simply showing a short video on electro-sensitivity was enough to trigger later symptoms &ndash; and the evidence seems to show that outbreaks of &ldquo;wind turbine syndrome&rdquo; follow local media reports. In other words, the health scares themselves are actually making people ill.</p><p>How about doctors themselves? Rebecca Wells at the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in North Carolina points out that it&rsquo;s a major dilemma for modern medicine. Doctors are obliged to be honest about a drug&rsquo;s side effects &ndash; they need to gain &ldquo;informed consent&rdquo; &ndash; but that is a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3352765/\">fuzzy concept when the information itself could make someone sicker</a>. &ldquo;There is no hard and fast truth of what a medicine does,&rdquo; Wells says. In the future, she thinks doctors may need to develop new procedures to decide which facts to divulge and the way they frame that information. Due care is crucial in each case &ndash; as Benedetti points out, the contagious nature of the nocebo means that a single person&rsquo;s side-effects could soon spread to a much larger group.</p><p>More positively, education itself may help sap the nocebo effect of its power. Mitsikostas, for instance, tries to explain to his patients that they have to be wary of their own expectations. &ldquo;We have to make the patient understand that it&rsquo;s an internal fear that we both have to try to fight,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>The mind-body connection, he says, is something that we can ill afford to ignore, despite our amazing new medical tools. &ldquo;For millennia, medicine was basically placebo &ndash; by using expectation, magicians used the will to heal,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It is not enough to overcome disease &ndash; but it is indispensable.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-11T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The contagious thought that could kill you ","HeadlineShort":"The thought that could kill you","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"To die, sometimes you need only believe you are ill, and as David Robson discovers, we can unwittingly ‘catch’ such fears, often with terrifying consequences.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"To die, sometimes you need only believe you are ill, and as David Robson discovers, we can unwittingly ‘catch’ such fears, often with terrifying consequences.","SummaryShort":"Deadly if you believe it – and contagious","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-02-11T02:42:14Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"501b5d72-b021-4ba6-a02e-84fcc597b84f","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-02-11T02:42:14Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150210-can-you-think-yourself-to-death","_id":"55dc584f983c37e31d30c781"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>Some myths about the brain, such as the idea we only use 10% of our grey matter, are notorious, especially among neuroscientists. These myths crop up every now and then (look at the premise of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_%282014_film%29\">Lucy movie</a> this summer), but they are quickly shot down by those in the know.</p><p>In contrast to these enduring stories, other misconceptions are stealthier and slip beneath the radar unrecognised. One of these is the idea that the human brain is served by five senses. This belief is so ingrained that even the scientifically literate will treat it as taken-for-granted common knowledge.</p><p>Perhaps it is due to the idea&rsquo;s noble origins. The principle of five basic human senses is often traced back to Aristotle&rsquo;s De Anima (On the Soul), in which he devotes a separate chapter to vision, hearing, touch, smell and taste. Today, the five senses are considered such an elementary truth that it is sometimes used as a point of consensus before writers embark on more mysterious or contentious topics. &ldquo;What do we actually mean by reality?&rdquo; asked the author of <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528840.500-reality-the-definition.html\">a recent article</a> in New Scientist magazine. &ldquo;A straightforward answer is that it means everything that appears to our five senses.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Incoming information</strong></p><p>If only it were that simple. Simply defining what we mean by a &ldquo;sense&rdquo; leads you down a slippery slope into philosophy. One, somewhat vague, definition might argue that a human sense is simply a unique way for the brain to receive information about the world and the body. If that is the case, then we can claim with confidence that there are certainly more than five human senses.</p><p>First consider the senses that relate to the position of our bodies. Close your eyes, and then touch your right forefinger to your left elbow tip. Easy? How did you do it? Somehow you knew where the end of your finger was and you also knew the position of your left elbow. This sense is known as proprioception and it&rsquo;s the awareness we have of where each of our body parts is located in space. Proprioception is possible thanks to receptors in our muscles known as spindles, which tell the brain about the current length and stretch of the muscles.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02c7y6n\"}}</p><p>Now imagine you are blindfolded and I tilted you forwards slowly. You&rsquo;d immediately have a sensation of how your body&rsquo;s position was changing in relation to gravity. This is thanks to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20141007-why-astronauts-get-space-stupid\">fluid-filled vestibular system</a> in your inner ear, which helps us keep balance. This system also gives us our experience of acceleration through space, and it links up with the eyes, making it possible to cancel out our own motion. If you wiggle your head around while reading, for example, you&rsquo;ll see that it makes little difference to your ability to read and stay focused on the words.</p><p>There are also numerous senses providing us with information about the inner state of our bodies. The most obvious of these are hunger and thirst, inner body pain, and the need to empty the bladder or bowel. Less obvious and less available to conscious awareness are incoming signals about blood pressure, the pH level of the cerebrospinal fluid, plus many more.</p><p>Some might take that definition further, to argue that the senses should be defined by the types of receptors we have; a different sensor means a different sense. If that were the case, then even well-known senses quickly split into different varieties. For instance, if you closed your eyes and I surprised you with an ice cube down your back, you&rsquo;d experience a shock of cold. This sensation would be distinct from the mere touch of a plastic cube, say. Alongside temperature-sensitive receptors, packed in our skin we also have receptors dedicated to mechanical pressure, pain (known as nociceptors) and itch (pruritic receptors). Using the same logic, however, taste can be divided into sweet, sour, salty and bitter and potentially &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-29912877\">umami</a>&rdquo;, which is activated by monosodium glutamate and is associated with a &ldquo;meaty&rdquo; flavour. Splitting the senses in this way doesn&rsquo;t feel like the most intuitive way of dealing with the question, however, and it becomes even more absurd if we turn to smell: humans have over 1,000 distinct olfactory receptors tuned to different odorous molecules. Should each one be counted as a different sense?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02c7xwg\"}}</p><p>At the other extreme, you could restrict our definition of discrete sense to the physical categories of incoming information. We can simplify the human senses down to just three &ndash; mechanical (which takes in touch, hearing and proprioception); chemical (including taste, smell and internal senses); and light.</p><p>Yet another way of approaching this issue is to think not about the category of incoming information or the perceptual experience, but about how incoming sensory information is used. A great example is the human capacity for echo-location. Human echo-location works by a person emitting a clicking sound with the tongue and listening for how it rebounds off the immediate environment. In the USA there is even a remarkable team of blind cyclists &ndash; Team Bat &ndash; led by Daniel Kisch, who use echo-location to go mountain biking (see <a href=\"http://www.worldaccessfortheblind.org\">www.worldaccessfortheblind.org</a> for videos). This ability depends on the traditional sense of hearing, but the perceptual experience and function is more akin to vision. You don&rsquo;t need to be blind to try it; even sighted people can learn to &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.livescience.com/39231-humans-can-learn-to-echolocate.html\">see in the dark</a>&rdquo; using echo-location. For these reasons, some consider it a separate sense.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{\"id\":\"Human-echolocation-Daniel-Kish\"}}</p><p>As you can see, there is no single, logical way to define the senses. In some ways, it might make little sense to draw divisions between them at all &ndash; considering that they often seem to blend together; the colour of food &ndash; and even the sounds of a restaurant &ndash; can influence taste, for instance. Understanding these relationships is important when studying conditions like synaesthesia and could even shed light on consciousness itself.</p><p>But whichever way you look at it, five is a pretty arbitrary and meaningless number &ndash; a glaring &ldquo;myth&rdquo; of the brain that needs further recognition. Indeed, once you start thinking about all the different kinds of information reaching the human brain, you might even find that you develop a brand new sense &ndash; a radar-like sensitivity to some of the other misconceptions regarding the way the brain experiences the world. You might have once called it a &ldquo;sixth sense&rdquo; &ndash; but you know better now, don&rsquo;t you?</p><p>This article is based on a chapter from Christian Jarrett&rsquo;s new book <a href=\"http://eu.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1118312716,descCd-buy.html\">Great Myths of the Brain</a> (Wiley).</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook</a> or <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\">Google+</a> page, or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-19T12:31:54Z","HeadlineLong":"Psychology: How many senses do we have?","HeadlineShort":"Do humans have secret senses?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often talk of having five senses as a universal truth.

There is a strange mechanical rumbling in the background, and I hear footsteps padding around the room beyond. In my mounting claustrophobia, I ask myself why I am here &ndash; but there is no way out now. A few moments later, the light dims, and as the man speaks, my thoughts begin to fade.</p><p><em>&ldquo;The engineer has developed a way of taking control of your thoughts from the inside.

I am about to be possessed.</p><p>The man who will soon take control of my thoughts is Eamonn Walsh, a psychologist who uses hypnosis to investigate psychoses at the Institute of Psychiatry in London. The idea is to turn healthy subjects into &lsquo;virtual patients&rsquo; suffering full-on delusions, such as being possessed by a paranormal entity, allowing the scientists to understand the underlying illness in a new way, and potentially find treatments</p><p>The scientists are understandably keen to distance themselves from stage hypnotists. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not flaky, it&rsquo;s not for entertainment &ndash; we&rsquo;ve got carefully specific research goals,&rdquo; says Mitul Mehta, who collaborates with Walsh on these studies. It&rsquo;s a bold idea, but can it possibly work? And what does it feel like to lose total control of your mind?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021zhyw\"}}</p><p>I confess that I was a little nervous when I entered the lab earlier that day. Hypnosis research has a somewhat murky history; one early experiment very nearly ended in murder. The researchers in question were two of the most prominent doctors in France at the beginning of the 20th Century: Jean-Martin Charcot, now considered the &ldquo;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean-Martin_Charcot\">founder of modern neurology</a>&rdquo;, and Georges Gilles de la Tourette, who is most famous for the disease that bears his name. They studied cases of &ldquo;hysteria&rdquo; &ndash; in which patients were suddenly unable to feel or move their limbs, for instance, despite no observable injury. Both doctors believed that the disorders might share certain characteristics with hypnosis &ndash; a hypothesis they tested by showing that people with hysteria are more susceptible to suggestion than healthy subjects.</p><p>They soon veered into less reputable territory, however. At the time, newspapers reported tales of criminals &ldquo;mesmerising&rdquo; innocent people to carry out nefarious deeds. Despite his scepticism about the reports, Gilles de la Tourette decided to hypnotise a hysterical patient, Blanche, to see if it might be possible. Placing her in a trance, he showed Blanche a &lsquo;poisoned&rsquo; glass of beer and asked to feed the poison to another man, known as Mr G. Blanche happily complied, kissing Mr G as she did so, before he feigned death. She later denied all knowledge of the apparent murder.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0222kc7\"}}</p><p>Perhaps it was this cavalier attitude that nearly cost Gilles de la Tourette his life. One day in December 1893, he was confronted at home by another one of his hospital&rsquo;s patients, a 29-year-old woman named Rose Kamper-Lecoq. Claiming that her hypnosis sessions had irretrievably altered her will, she whipped out a pistol and shot at him three times. Only one of the bullets penetrated his skull, but he was well enough to write to a friend the same evening, concluding in a wonderfully blas&eacute; fashion: &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19602893\">quelle dr&ocirc;le d&rsquo;histoire</a>&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;what a funny story&rdquo;.</p><p>Kamper-Lecoq&rsquo;s story is all the more striking in light of today&rsquo;s research. Although her violence almost certainly wasn&rsquo;t caused by hypnosis, it seems to have stemmed from many of the delusions that psychologists like Walsh are now unpicking with their virtual patients. She was said to be sure that Gilles de la Tourette was in love with her &ndash; a disorder known as &ldquo;erotomania&rdquo; &ndash; and she also (falsely) believed that someone was controlling her mind remotely: exactly the kind of mind possession I signed up for. I just hope it doesn&rsquo;t end with me putting a bullet in somebody&rsquo;s skull.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0222f5d\"}}</p><p>Before I was possessed, I first was tested for my &ldquo;hypnotisability&rdquo;. The procedure usually involves some kind of guided relaxation, followed by a series of suggestions that are meant to warp your perceptions and behaviours. I was told that I could hear a fly buzzing around my head, for example; later, the researcher said that a balloon would slowly lift my arm into the air. From what I can remember, my arm felt light, as if it were filled with helium, and before I had realised it, it was already floating upwards. The buzzing of the &ldquo;fly&rdquo;, meanwhile, felt like the flashes of images and voices you might begin to hear if you are very tired and about to drop off to sleep &ndash; you realise they aren&rsquo;t real, yet they are perceptible all the same. Based on my responses, I scored 10 out of 12 &ndash; a degree of suggestibility that puts me in the top 10% of the population.</p><p>Given the reliance on subjective reports, the authenticity of hypnotic behaviour has been a matter of debate. &ldquo;Some believe that hypnosis is pure fakery, whereas others believe it is a genuinely altered state of consciousness that can produce profound changes in perception, thought, and memory,&rdquo; says <a href=\"http://www.cogsci.mq.edu.au/members/profile.php?memberID=207\">Rochelle Cox</a>, a cognitive scientist at Macquarie University in Australia.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0220s5m\"}}</p><p>Although I didn&rsquo;t feel like I was faking it, I ask Walsh whether he is ever concerned his subjects are pretending. He agrees the possibility casts an ever-present shadow over the research. &ldquo;Anytime you submit a study to a journal, it&rsquo;s one of the reviewers&rsquo; favourite questions,&rdquo; he says. But advances in brain scanning have begun to lay those concerns to rest. While in the brain scanner, the hypnotiser might tell the subject to see a black and white photograph in colour, for instance &ndash; and you would see the areas for colour processing bursting into action as if they were actually looking at a real-life scene. Importantly, when the same subjects are simply asked to &lsquo;pretend&rsquo; to experience, or imagine, those feelings, you don&rsquo;t see the same activity. Such results have converted many sceptics.</p><p>Along the way, the researchers have edged closer to understanding what causes the hypnotic state in the first place. It seems that hypnotic induction turns something like a dimmer switch in the brain&rsquo;s frontal lobes. These regions are thought to generate &ldquo;higher-order thoughts&rdquo; &ndash; reflective awareness of your own wants and needs and motives. Take that away, it seems, and you begin to do and feel things without realising why. That might explain why students tanked up on alcoholic drinks &ndash; the equivalent to two pints of beer &ndash; score much higher on the standard hypnotisability tests; alcohol is known to dampen frontal lobe activity, says Zoltan Dienes at the University of Sussex in Brighton, UK.</p><p>Why some people naturally drop into that state, while others find it harder, is an open question, however. Twin studies suggest it can be passed through the generations, and there&rsquo;s some <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nrn/journal/v14/n8/full/nrn3538.html\">evidence it can be inherited</a>. Importantly, people tend to retain the same score throughout their life, so it could just be another fundamental feature of our minds like IQ.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p021zhs2\"}}</p><p>Along these lines, much of the work so far has been devoted to studying whether hypnotic suggestion could be used in <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23479676\">place of painkillers</a>. Randomised controlled trials have also investigated whether hypnosis could <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23427838\">reduce stress</a>, help <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24419112\">cancer patients with their fatigue during chemotherapy</a>, treat irritable bowel syndrome, and even <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22459017\">boost students&rsquo; learning of new skills</a>.</p><p>Around the year 2000, however, the research began to take a more macabre turn: rather than taking the ill and making them better, psychologists used it to plant delusions in the minds of the healthy. Like Gilles de la Tourette&rsquo;s studies a hundred years before, one of the first investigations was inspired by a patient suffering from &lsquo;hysterical paralysis&rsquo; &ndash; the sensation that she could not move her left leg, even though there was no physical disability. To see if they could recreate the disorder, researchers hypnotised a subject to feel the same sensations, and placed him in a brain scanner. The results &ndash; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10768440\">published in the medical journal The Lancet</a> &ndash; revealed exactly the same pattern of activity in his brain as the hysterical patient, strongly supporting the possibility that hypnosis could be used to test hypotheses about real mental conditions.</p><p>Since then, psychologists have used it to conjure many other types of delusion, including erotomania, Capgras syndrome &ndash; the sensation that your loved ones have been replaced by a doppelganger &ndash; and mirror misidentification, in which people fail to recognise their own reflections. &ldquo;Patients may cover up all the mirrors in their house because they think the stranger is following them around,&rdquo; explains Cox, who carried out many of the studies. Hypnosis, she says, can produce almost identical symptoms. &ldquo;Both are compellingly real, believed with conviction, and resistant to rational counterargument.&rdquo; It is completely reversible, the researchers reassure me &ndash; all subjects leave the labs free of delusion.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0220w2j\"}}</p><p>Hypnosis lets the scientist create the symptoms at will, while also manipulating the conditions to try to see what underlying cognitive processes might be misfiring in order to conjure the delusions. Eventually, you might even be able to use the hypnotised subjects to test certain kinds of therapies &ndash; before you risk them on mentally ill patients.</p><p>Needless to say, some of the researchers are sceptical of the benefits of this approach. Dienes, for instance, agrees that these virtual patients may be useful for the &lsquo;hysteria&rsquo; disorders &ndash; like the limb paralysis. But he is sceptical that you can hypnotise somebody to experience the highly complex and terrifying psychosis of a disease like schizophrenia.</p><p>Walsh readily acknowledges that it can&rsquo;t recreate every aspect of an illness, but sees hypnosis as a complementary technique that adds to the understanding gleaned from direct observations of real patients. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s is just another way of looking at things &ndash; you&rsquo;re shining a light on the darkness from a different angle,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>Before I allowed myself to be possessed, Walsh showed me two prints by the late 16th Century painter, Caravaggio, to make a point about the patients who believe they are controlled for real. One shows Saint Matthew as an &ldquo;illiterate oaf&rdquo;, his feet still dirty from his work in the fields. An angel is guiding his hand as he writes the gospel. In the second, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s been promoted&rdquo; &ndash; Saint Matthew is clean and has a halo. The angel is now depicted above his head, whispering God&rsquo;s words into his mind.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0222fdd\"}}</p><p>The two paintings, he says, perfectly depict the two different ways in which patients experience possession: either they feel that another being is controlling their movements, or that another person is directly planting thoughts into their head. Such feelings may be due to mental illnesses like schizophrenia or psychotic depression, or the result of cultural practices such as shamanism that might lead people to feel like they are channelling another spirit, which may also be triggered by a &lsquo;dissociative&rsquo; state similar to hypnosis. I will experience both, he says.</p><p>One of the team&rsquo;s biggest challenges was to create suitable hypnotic suggestions that could feasibly manifest in a delusion, without being too scary. Possession stories often reflect contemporary culture of the day &ndash; in the Industrial Revolution, people believed the factory looms were directing their behaviour; Kamper-Lecoq&rsquo;s delusions were influenced by her brushes with &lsquo;mesmerism&rsquo;; and in the early 20th Century, it was thought to be radio antennae planting ideas into people&rsquo;s head. So rather than creating a spiritual demon, the team told a story of an &lsquo;engineer&rsquo; doing research into mind control &ndash; a tale that isn&rsquo;t too menacing, but which neatly draws on today&rsquo;s fears about privacy and individual liberty.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0220sk9\"}}</p><p>Walsh puts me in the shell of an old brain scanner, which is often used to test procedures before hiring the real thing. At first I feel crushingly claustrophobic, but I soon forget those feelings as he counts down from 20, leading me gently into the hypnotic state. With a pen in my hand and a sheet of paper on my lap, my task will be to hear a word and finish the sentence under three different scenarios; first Walsh tells me that the engineer is whispering the words to write directly into my brain; then that he is able to direct the movements of my hand; and finally that the engineer is in complete control of both my thoughts and movements.</p><p>The first scenario had only a minimal effect: I seem to have to wait a little before the words come suddenly, as if from nowhere, but it doesn&rsquo;t feel so different to my normally sporadic mind. But when Walsh instead tells me that the engineer has now taken over my movements, it is much more noticeable: my hand seems to move in a jerky, mechanical fashion, and it feels like my fingers are dancing to their own tune. It is then that I also begin to get flashes of the engineer himself &ndash; who I picture to be a hunched man with a wide grin and a long, grey pony-tail. By the time we reach the third set of suggestions &ndash; where Walsh tells me that the engineer will now control my hand movements, and my thoughts &ndash; the engineer&rsquo;s power over me becomes much more vivid. My writing becomes faster, and more intense, and I get the distinct feeling that I am watching myself, from the outside. At points it feels like I can almost hear the engineer directing his thought-control machine. It is only when Walsh ends the session, and counts back up to 20, that I fully realise how strange the sensation was: a little like the moment of lucidity once you awake from a fevered dream.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0220lt6\"}}</p><p>When I tell Walsh about my impressions, he says they are pretty much in-line with his other subjects. As one person put it: &ldquo;I felt as if my hand had been made of metal.&rdquo; While many, like me, pictured the engineer visually, others felt he was more amorphous: &ldquo;Like a presence, as opposed to something that one can see&rdquo;.</p><p>So far, these investigations have suggested a few networks of brain regions that might lie behind these delusions. When a person believes that their hand is being controlled by another being, you find an abnormally high connectivity between the motor areas that control movement, and regions that help us understand another&rsquo;s motives and actions. Conversely, when the subjects were told that the engineer was inserting the thoughts into their mind during the writing task, they had much lower activity in the language areas of the brain &ndash; perhaps because they were less conscious of the generation of the words.</p><p>In some scenarios, they found increased activity in the areas involved in &lsquo;error detection&rsquo;. In normal everyday life, these regions normally keep track of our movements and the way they are executed, and then fire if things don&rsquo;t go according to plan &ndash; like when you trip up. So it&rsquo;s possible that the heightened activity reflects the subjects&rsquo; feelings that their movements were becoming more unpredictable, as if they were no longer under their own control.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0220tkx\"}}</p><p>If the same regions of activity continue to emerge in further studies of hypnotic subjects and real patients, it might suggest new treatments. For instance, it might be possible to find drugs that specifically alter activity in the regions in question; alternatively, non-invasive brain stimulation could help correct any abnormal circuits &ndash; preventing the &lsquo;error network&rsquo; from going into overdrive. The team are also interested in using neurofeedback &ndash; technologies that allow patients to view their neural activity on a screen, and correct it appropriately. &ldquo;We are a few steps away from doing this,&rdquo; says Quinton Deeley, who has run many of the experiments. &ldquo;But we are at the threshold of doing it for anxiety and attention deficit disorder, and I don&rsquo;t see why they couldn&rsquo;t be applied to things like delusions&rdquo;.</p><p>Away from mental health, it&rsquo;s possible the work might shed light on more general phenomena. It&rsquo;s possible that it could relate to religious phenomena &ndash; like the feeling of &lsquo;talking in tongues&rsquo; or the kind of mass hysteria seen in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salem_witch_trials\">Salem Witch Trials</a>. And possibly even what is going on the brain when we first conceive of an idea, and how it takes hold and guides our behaviour.</p><p>My brief period of possession has certainly made me more conscious of my own thoughts, and the strange ways they can seem to pop into your head. At least, I&rsquo;m pretty certain that belief is my own&hellip; or is that just the engineer, guiding my hand as I type?</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-07-03T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Hypnosis: The day my mind was 'possessed'","HeadlineShort":"The day I lost control of my mind","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Scientists are using hypnosis to understand why some people believe they’re inhabited by paranormal beings.

The position you are taking makes no logical sense. Just listen up and I'll be more than happy to elaborate on the many, many reasons why I'm right and you are wrong. Are you feeling ready to be convinced?</p><p>Whether the subject is climate change, the Middle East or forthcoming holiday plans, this is the approach many of us adopt when we try to convince others to change their minds. It's also an approach that, more often than not, leads to the person on the receiving end hardening their existing position. Fortunately research suggests there is a better way &ndash; one that involves more listening, and less trying to bludgeon your opponent into submission.</p><p>A little over a decade ago Leonid Rozenblit and Frank Keil from Yale University suggested that in many instances people believe they understand how something works when in fact their understanding is superficial at best. They called this phenomenon \"<a href=\"http://www.yale.edu/cogdevlab/aarticles/IOED%20proofs.pdf%201.pdf\">the illusion of explanatory depth</a>\". They began by asking their study participants to rate how well they understood how things like flushing toilets, car speedometers and sewing machines worked, before asking them to explain what they understood and then answer questions on it. The effect they revealed was that, on average, people in the experiment rated their understanding as much worse after it had been put to the test.</p><p>What happens, argued the researchers, is that we mistake our familiarity with these things for the belief that we have a detailed understanding of how they work. Usually, nobody tests us and if we have any questions about them we can just take a look. Psychologists call this idea that humans have a tendency to take mental short cuts when making decisions or assessments the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_miser\">\"cognitive miser\" theory</a>.</p><p>Why would we bother expending the effort to really understand things when we can get by without doing so? The interesting thing is that we manage to hide from ourselves exactly how shallow our understanding is.</p><p>It's a phenomenon that will be familiar to anyone who has ever had to teach something. Usually, it only takes the first moments when you start to rehearse what you'll say to explain a topic, or worse, the first student question, for you to realise that you don't truly understand it. All over the world, teachers say to each other \"I didn't really understand this until I had to teach it\". Or as researcher and inventor <a href=\"http://www.changizi.com/\">Mark Changizi quipped</a>: \"I find that no matter how badly I teach I still learn something\".</p><p><strong>Explain yourself</strong></p><p>Research <a href=\"http://pss.sagepub.com/content/24/6/939.short\">published last year</a> on this illusion of understanding shows how the effect might be used to convince others they are wrong. The research team, led by Philip Fernbach, of the University of Colorado, reasoned that the phenomenon might hold as much for political understanding as for things like how toilets work. Perhaps, they figured, people who have strong political opinions would be more open to other viewpoints, if asked to explain exactly how they thought the policy they were advocating would bring about the effects they claimed it would.</p><p>Recruiting a sample of Americans via the internet, they polled participants on a set of contentious US policy issues, such as imposing sanctions on Iran, healthcare and approaches to carbon emissions. One group was asked to give their opinion and then provide reasons for why they held that view. This group got the opportunity to put their side of the issue, in the same way anyone in an argument or debate has a chance to argue their case.</p><p>Those in the second group did something subtly different. Rather that provide reasons, they were asked to explain how the policy they were advocating would work. They were asked to trace, step by step, from start to finish, the causal path from the policy to the effects it was supposed to have.</p><p>The results were clear. People who provided reasons remained as convinced of their positions as they had been before the experiment. Those who were asked to provide explanations softened their views, and reported a correspondingly larger drop in how they rated their understanding of the issues. People who had previously been strongly for or against carbon emissions trading, for example, tended to became more moderate &ndash; ranking themselves as less certain in their support or opposition to the policy.</p><p>So this is something worth bearing in mind next time you're <a href=\"https://www.contributoria.com/issue/2014-05/5319c4add63a707e780000cd\">trying to convince a friend</a> that we should build more nuclear power stations, that the collapse of capitalism is inevitable, or that dinosaurs co-existed with humans 10,000 years ago. Just remember, however, there's a chance you might need to be able to explain precisely why you think you are correct. Otherwise you might end up being the one who changes their mind.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-05-21T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The best way to win an argument","HeadlineShort":"The best way to win an argument","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"How do you change someone’s mind if you think you are right and they are wrong?

It was the beating of his &ldquo;second heart&rdquo;.</p><p>The small mechanical pump was meant to relieve the burden of his failing cardiac muscles, but Carlos (not his real name) disliked the sensation. The beat of the machine seemed to replace his pulse, a sensation that warped his body image: as the device throbbed above his navel, Carlos had the eerie feeling that his chest had dropped into the abdomen.</p><p>It was a strange, unsettling feeling. But when neuroscientist Agustin Ibanez met Carlos, he suspected even odder effects were to come. By changing the man&rsquo;s heart, Ibanez thought, the doctors might have also changed their patient&rsquo;s mind: Carlos would now think, feel and act differently as a result of the implant.</p><p>How come? We often talk about &ldquo;following the heart&rdquo;, but it is only recently that scientists have begun to show that there is literal truth in the cliche; the heaving lump of muscle contributes to our emotions and the mysterious feelings of &ldquo;intuition&rdquo; in a very real way. Everything from your empathy for another person&rsquo;s pain to the hunch that your spouse is having an affair may originate from subtle signals in your heart and the rest of your body.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23887813\">the man who feels two hearts</a> offered Ibanez, who is based at Favaloro University in Buenos Aires, a unique opportunity to test those ideas.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;Cranial stuffing&rdquo;</strong></p><p>Ibanez&rsquo;s work chimes with millennia of speculation about the heart&rsquo;s role in cognition &ndash; which was sometimes thought to supersede the brain&rsquo;s. Touching the cool, moist grey matter of the cortex, for instance, <a href=\"http://dspace.ucalgary.ca/jspui/bitstream/1880/47541/1/Reynolds_2007.pdf\">Aristotle assumed that the brain&rsquo;s main function was to chill the passions erupting from the heart</a> &ndash; which he considered the seat of the soul. For similar reasons, embalmers in ancient Egyptians made sure to leave the heart in the chest, but happily removed the mere &ldquo;cranial stuffing&rdquo; from the head.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhfl\"}}</p><p>We now take a more cerebral view of thought, even if the view of the heart as the font of our emotions has lingered; just consider the many metaphors we use to describe feelings today. William James, the founder of modern psychology, helped formalise these ideas in the 19th Century by suggesting that emotions are really a back-and-forth feedback cycle between the body and the brain. According to his theory, the brain might be able to register a threat intellectually &ndash; but it is our awareness of the racing heartbeat and sweaty palms that transforms an abstract concept into a visceral emotion.</p><p>James&rsquo; ideas also raised an important question: if everybody has different bodily awareness, would that shape the emotions they experience? The idea was difficult to test, however, but a hundred years later scientists are now on the case.</p><p>The studies first asked subjects to count their heartbeats based solely on the feelings within their chest; they weren&rsquo;t allowed to put their hand on their heart or actively take their pulse. Try it for yourself, and you&rsquo;ll see that this kind of &ldquo;interoception&rdquo; can be surprisingly difficult; around one in four people miss the mark by about 50%, suggesting they have little to no perception of the movements inside them; only a quarter get 80% accuracy. After testing their cardiac awareness, the researchers then gave the volunteers various cognitive tests.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhqz\"}}</p><p>James, it turned out, was spot on. People with more bodily awareness tend have <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16729289\">more intense reactions to emotive pictures</a> and report being more greatly moved by them; they are also better at describing their feelings. Importantly, this sensitivity seems to extend to others&rsquo; feelings &ndash; they <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24559130\">are better at recognising emotions in others&rsquo; faces</a> &ndash; and they are also quicker to learn to avoid a threat, such as a small electric shock in the lab, perhaps because those more intense bodily feelings saturate their memories, making the aversion more visceral. &ldquo;It may quickly clue us in to the relative goodness or badness of the objects, choices, or avenues of action that we are facing,&rdquo; says Daniella Furman at the University of California, Berkeley. In other words, people who are in tune with their bodies have a richer, more vivid emotional life &ndash; including both the ups and downs of life. &ldquo;We may not be able to describe the particular physiological signature of a pleasurable experience, but we would probably recognise the sensations when they occur,&rdquo; she says.</p><p><strong>Emotional barometer</strong></p><p>These <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21106893\">secret bodily signals may also lie behind our intuition</a> &ndash; the indefinable hunches that you have the winning hand in poker, say, according to an elegant study by Barney Dunn at the University of Exeter. The task was simple: the volunteers were asked to choose cards from four decks, and they would win money if it matched the colour of another, upturned card.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhbg\"}}</p><p>The game was rigged so that you were slightly more likely to win from two of the decks, and lose if you picked from the other two. Dunn found that the people who could track their heartbeat with the most accuracy would tend to pick from certain decks, whereas those with poor interoception were more likely to choose at random.&nbsp;</p><p>The bodily-aware people weren&rsquo;t always correct &ndash; they were the worst losers as well as the best winners &ndash; but the point was that they were more likely to follow their hunches.</p><p>So the folklore may be right: people who are in touch with their heart are more likely to be swayed by their instincts &ndash; for good or bad. All of which prompted Ibanez to wonder what would happen when you are fitted with an artificial heart? If Carlos experienced substantial changes, it would offer important new evidence that our mind extends well beyond the brain.</p><p>And that is exactly what he found. When Carlos tapped out his pulse, for instance, he followed the machine&rsquo;s rhythms rather than his own heartbeat. The fact that this also changed other perceptions of his body &ndash; seeming to expand the size of his chest, for instance &ndash; is perhaps to be expected; in some ways, changing the position of the heart was creating a sensation not unlike the famous &ldquo;<a href=\"http://www.gizmag.com/visualized-heartbeat-out-of-body-experience/28728/\">rubber hand illusion</a>&rdquo;. But crucially, it also seemed to have markedly altered certain social and emotional skills. Carlos seemed to lack empathy when he viewed pictures of people having a painful accident, for instance. He also had more general problems with his ability to read other&rsquo;s motives, and, crucially, intuitive decision making &ndash; all of which is in line with the idea that the body rules emotional cognition. &ldquo;It is a very interesting, very intriguing study,&rdquo; says Dunn of the findings.</p><p><strong>&ldquo;A lifeless shell&rdquo;</p><p></strong></p><p>Sadly, Carlos died from complications during later treatments &ndash; but Ibanez now hopes to continue his studies with other patients. He is currently performing tests on people undergoing a full heart transplant to see how it could influence interoception. Damage to the vagal nerve should cut off some of the internal signals sent from the heart to the brain, which might then impact their cognition.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkhd7\"}}</p><p>Away from the cardiac clinic, he is also looking at whether a fault in the link between body and brain could lead to strange depersonalisation disorders, in which patients have the eerie feeling that they don&rsquo;t inhabit their own body. &ldquo;I feel as though I'm not alive, as though my body is an empty, lifeless shell,&rdquo; <a href=\"http://informahealthcare.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1025389031000138538\">one patient told researchers</a>. &ldquo;I seem to be walking in a world I recognise but don't feel.&rdquo; Ibanez has found that they tend to show worse interoception, and brain scans suggest that this results from a breakdown in communication across the anterior insula &ndash; a deep fold of the cortex that is, tellingly, implicated in <a href=\"http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0098769\">body awareness, emotion perception, empathy, decision making &ndash; and the sense of self</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Dunn, who is a clinical psychologist, is more concerned about its relevance to depression. &ldquo;At the moment therapy is very much in the head &ndash; we change what the client thinks and trust that their emotions will follow up,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;But I often hit a wall: they say that they know these things intellectually, but emotionally they can&rsquo;t feel it.&rdquo;</p><p>Even after therapy has trained more positive thinking, the patient may still struggle to feel joy, for example &ndash; a problem that Dunn suspects may come from poor interoception. He gives the example that when you are walking around the park, your body might give you all sorts of pleasant feedback that shows you are relaxed and peaceful. &ldquo;But depressed clients seem to walk around the park without being engaged with the sensory experience,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;and then they come back and say it was flat and empty&rdquo;.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02dkj1d\"}}</p><p>Along these lines, Furman has found that people with major depressive disorder (but without other complications like anxiety) struggle to feel their own heart beat; and the poorer their awareness, the less likely they were to report positive experiences in their daily life. And as Dunn&rsquo;s work on decision making would have suggested, poor body perception also seemed to be linked to measures of indecision &ndash; a problem that blights many people with depression. Furman stresses, however, that there may be many different kinds of depression, and poor bodily awareness may only influence some of them.</p><p>It&rsquo;s not clear why some people may have reduced bodily awareness, but Dunn thinks it can be trained, with practice. He is currently looking into the use of mindfulness-based therapy, which encourages people to focus on the sensations in their body. He says the challenge is to try to recognise the feelings, even if they are unpleasant, without reacting to them in a knee-jerk way. You should then be better equipped to use the body as the &ldquo;emotional barometer&rdquo; to inform you about your state of mind and decide how to act. Another group has <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038304\">designed a rudimentary computer game</a> that asks you to tap a key with every four heartbeats, and flashes red when you are wrong, offering feedback that should boost body awareness.</p><p>So what are you waiting for? You can enjoy a richer, more emotional life; tune into the sensory pleasures of the world, and make better decisions. And all you have to do is listen to your heart.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20141205-the-man-with-two-hearts&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2d%2Fkh%2Fp02dkh7c.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\"><em>Share this story on Facebook</em></a><em>, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-05T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The mind-bending effects of feeling two hearts ","HeadlineShort":"The man with two hearts","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"When a man was fitted with a new heart, his mind changed in unusual ways.

She has short, brown hair, dancing eyes and a wide smile. We talk about the weather, music, and her life teaching English to foreign students. You would never believe her mind is being controlled by a bunch of processors more than 200 miles away.</p><p>Being possessed by a computer isn&#x2019;t too disconcerting, she later tells me. &#x201C;Today was the first time I thought, &#x2018;Eugh, I&#x2019;m just a body and nothing else&#x2019;.&#x201D;</p><p>To be technical, Sophia is an &#x201C;echoborg&#x201D; &#x2013; a living, breathing person who has temporarily given themselves over to become a robot&#x2019;s mouthpiece. Whatever she says originated in a chatbot across the internet, and is then fed to her through a small earpiece.</p><blockquote><p> Never for a minute did they think they were talking to a human-computer hybrid </p></blockquote><p>It sounds a little like dystopian science fiction. But in fact, the bizarre set-up has a serious purpose. The researchers at the London School of Economics want to understand the way that <a href="http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00634/abstract">the body and appearance of artificial intelligence can shape our perception</a>. It&#x2019;s particularly crucial to our understanding of AI because in the future we may be surrounded by machines that are indistinguishable from ourselves &#x2013; and we need to know how we will react.</p><p>&#x201C;Most of the time we encounter AI today, it&#x2019;s in a very mechanical interface,&#x201D; says Kevin Corti, one of the researchers. His answer was to use a human body, with a robot mind. &#x201C;This was a way of doing it so that people actually believe they are encountering another person.&#x201D;</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: Getty Images)" data-caption="Strange things happen when a chat bot takes over a human body (Credit: Getty Images)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: Getty Images)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2x/br/p02xbrcb.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: Getty Images) </a></div></p><p>Corti and his supervisor Alex Gillespie were inspired by work on &#x201C;cyranoids&#x201D; &#x2013; an experiment invented by the controversial psychologist Stanley Milgram. He is most famous for his notorious <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milgram_experiment">experiment on obedience</a> &#x2013; in which he asked subjects to inflict electric shocks, of increasing voltage, on another person. Even when it looked like the shocks were becoming dangerously painful, many continued &#x2013; apparently showing how easily we will harm another rather than question authority.</p><p>By the end of his life, however, Milgram seems to have turned his mind to the gentler subject of body perception. When we are talking to someone, do we really listen to what they are saying? Or are our opinions pre-formed, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20150707-is-faceism-spoiling-your-life">based solely on what a person looks like</a>?</p><p>To find out, he took a leaf out of a 19th Century play, Cyrano de Bergerac. De Bergerac is an accomplished soldier, a witty poet, and a skilled musician, but he considers himself too ugly to woo his pretty cousin Roxane. So instead, he offers to help his handsome-but-dim rival Christian win her hand instead, by telling him exactly what to say. In the most famous scene of the play, Cyrano hides in the bushes, quietly prompting Christian with sweet nothings, who then repeats them to Roxane, who is standing on her balcony.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: iStock)" data-caption="So-called &quot;cyranoids&quot; are humans who have allowed another person to dictate what they say and do (Credit: iStock)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: iStock)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2x/br/p02xbrn2.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: iStock) </a></div></p><p>A similar set-up, Milgram realised, would be the perfect way of testing how much our body shapes perceptions our mind. So he set up experiments in which a &#x201C;cyranoid&#x201D; is fed words from another person in another room, through a small radio transmitter in the ear. Like Roxane in the play, the other people they encounter are not told of the strange set-up.</p><blockquote><p> The fact that everything the other person said originated in the mind of a distal source simple didn&#x2019;t enter the picture </p></blockquote><p>Milgram was amazed to discover that most people have lengthy, 20-minute conversations with the cyranoid without noticing that anything was amiss. &#x201C;The fact that everything the other person said originated in the mind of a distal source&#x2026; simply doesn&apos;t enter into the picture,&#x201D; he wrote. He then started to push the set-up further and further, seeing, for example, what happens when an aged professor controlled a young child, for instance.</p><p>Milgram died in 1984, before he&#x2019;d finished his enquiries, and his cyranoid experiments remained forgotten for two decades before Gillespie decided to revisit the idea. One of his first attempts replicated one of Milgram&#x2019;s experiments with a child cyranoid. In this case, Gillespie fed lines to an 11-year-old boy, being interviewed by a panel of adults. Their capacity to patronise was astonishing. &#x201C;I was questioned about graphene, Henry James, the death of Margaret Thatcher, the financial crisis and they go, well, that boy&#x2019;s pretty clever, he&#x2019;s probably got a mental age of 15,&#x201D; remembers Gillespie.</p><p><strong>Living zombies</strong></p><p>The philosophical point is that people are really bad at judging if someone is acting of their own free will, or if they are a &#x201C;zombie&#x201D; acting another&#x2019;s commands. &#x201C;No matter how big the incongruity between body and mind, people won&#x2019;t notice,&#x201D; says Corti. Or, put another way &#x2013; we go by appearances more than judging the substance of someone&#x2019;s thoughts.</p><p>It&#x2019;s easy to be sceptical, but I too was taken in when I visited the team&#x2019;s labs and Gillespie introduced me to Corti. The young woman in front of me certainly didn&#x2019;t look like the pictures I&#x2019;d seen of Kevin, I thought. I told myself that maybe Kevin was transgender. In fact, Kevin was in another room, and I was talking to Sophia (who, in real life, is a student at LSE and has conducted her own experiments using the same set-up). To me, it showed how easy it is to fall for the trick even when you might be expecting it. Clearly, knowledge of the cyranoid illusion isn&#x2019;t enough to break its spell.</p><blockquote><p> We can put the machine mind in a human body, to see what happens </p></blockquote><p>With these successes, Corti and Gillespie began to think of further extremes to test, and that was when they had their &#x2018;aha moment&#x2019;, he says. &#x201C;We thought, can we push it further so you don&#x2019;t even need a person to generate the words.&#x201D; The result is an &#x201C;echoborg&#x201D; &#x2013; a new breed of cyranoid in which a person relays the words of a chatbot, rather than a real person.</p><p>In this way, Corti hoped to catch a glimpse of the future, when robots are more realistic. &#x201C;We are very long way away from a perfectly human interface, but we can leapfrog that and put the machine mind in a human body, to see what happens.&#x201D;</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: Kevin Corti and Alex Gillespie)" data-caption="(Credit: Kevin Corti and Alex Gillespie)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: Kevin Corti and Alex Gillespie)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2x/bs/p02xbs8k.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: Kevin Corti and Alex Gillespie) </a></div></p><p>In one set-up, the participants were completely naive &#x2013; they had not been told they might be speaking to a robot. As Milgram might have predicted, they were still clueless, even after lengthy conversations. &#x201C;The vast majority of participants never picked up that they were speaking to the words of the computer program. They just assumed the person had some problem, where there social inhibitions had been diminished. Never for a minute did they think they were talking to a hybrid,&#x201D; says Corti.</p><p>Science fiction &#x2013; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humans_%28TV_series%29">including the recent TV series Humans</a> &#x2013; has long questioned whether robots could one day integrate in our society, to the point we no longer make a distinction between who is alive and who is electronic; Corti&#x2019;s experiments suggest that even with today&#x2019;s limited AI, we are already more easily fooled than you would imagine.</p><p>There&#x2019;s a catch, however. The team later tried to replicate the classic &#x201C;Turing Test&#x201D; of artificial intelligence. So in another condition, the participants were told that they may or may not be talking to a robot &#x2013; and they had to guess which. Surprisingly, in this situation, the chatbot was no more likely to pass the Turing Test than if they had been chatting on a screen. &#x201C;The bar is higher &#x2013; people expect more,&#x201D; says Gillespie.</p><p>It&#x2019;s a kind of paradox: without being told that we might be speaking to an AI, we simply assume that our conversation partner lies in the stranger part of the spectrum of human behaviour. But as soon as we know that it might not be human, we are extra critical of its failings. &#x201C;We might have AI&#x2019;s intelligent beyond belief but our knowledge of them being non-human might limit our desire to interact with them in a human way,&#x201D; says Corti.</p><p><strong>Uncanny, or awkward?</strong></p><p>Gillespie is particularly interested in the dilemmas that come with this kind of face-to-face encounter. &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t just walk away if eyes are looking at you,&#x201D; says Gillespie. &#x201C;There&#x2019;s an obligation &#x2013; and that&#x2019;s why people feel awkward, whereas you would never feel awkward talking to a screen,&#x201D; explains Gillespie.</p><p>I can relate to this. When I visited their labs and spoke to Sophia, she was very good at making the words flow naturally. Consider the following exchange:</p><p>Me: What&#x2019;s in the news today?<br> Sophia: According to the BBC, the UK will vote on the EU, but not on 5 May.<br> M: OK. Now, why don&#x2019;t you ask me a question?<br> S: Who is your favourite band?<br> M: I&#x2019;m not really into bands but I do like songwriters like Joni Mitchell.<br> S: Joni Mitchell, sure, I like her a lot. She often stops by to say hello.</p><p>In fact, had we been talking online, I would have been fooled (though I might have assumed she was a confabulator). But face-to-face with her strange answers, any pause or hiccup became excruciating &#x2013; in a way I wouldn&#x2019;t have experienced, had we been chatting over instant messenger.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit:Getty Images)" data-caption="Do we judge robots more by their brains or their appearance?

The more realistic computer animations of humans become, the more uncanny they appear &#x2013; a phenomenon seen in some CGI films. When you add conversation into the picture, it becomes even more unsettling. &#x201C;As artificial intelligence starts to get close to pass for human, it&#x2019;s not just uncanny, it&#x2019;s awkward. There&#x2019;s a kind of awkward valley,&#x201D; he says. It&#x2019;s a strange thought that our primary emotion in the face of future robots won&#x2019;t be the terror that science fiction predicts &#x2013; but embarrassment.</p><p>Overcoming that kind of issue will be crucial if AI is to become part of our lives, which is why Corti and Gillespie are keen to continue the echoborg experiments. &#x201C;I think it really gets us ahead of the curve,&#x201D; says Gillespie. &#x201C;If you look at history, we think it&#x2019;s powered by technology &#x2013; but it&#x2019;s not. It&#x2019;s public opinion. They will decide if these things are on the streets as police officers, so a huge amount of work needs to be done to see how we relate to it.&#x201D;</p><p>At their heart, these experiments may even question what means to be alive. Just consider if there really was a robot that looked like Sophia the echoborg, but without the stilted conversation of the chatbot. &#x201C;Is there something more to us than our behaviour?&#x201D; asks Corti. &#x201C;Because if a machine can mimic physical and behavioural dimensions of us, then why wouldn&#x2019;t we call that human?&#x201D;</p><p><em>Follow us</em> <em>on</em> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture"><em><strong>Facebook</strong></em></a><em>, </em><a href="https://twitter.com/bbc_future"><em><strong>Twitter</strong></em></a>, <a href="https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts"><em><strong>Google+</strong></em></a> and <strong><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com"><em>LinkedIn</em></a></strong></p> </div> </div> <!-- bottom-unit end --> <div class="clearfix"></div> <section> <div id="share-tools-bottom"></div> </section> </div> <!-- story end --> </div> <!-- primary content end --> <!-- secondary content start --> <div class="secondary-content"> <div class="mpu-wrapper"> <div data-advert-groups="1_2_3_4" class="bbccom_slot" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="bbccom_advert bbccom_display_none"> <script type="text/javascript"> /*<![CDATA[*/ if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.slot) { bbcdotcom.slot('ad_feature_rc', [1,2,3,4]); } /*]]>*/ </script> </div> <script type="text/javascript"> /*<![CDATA[*/ if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.show) { bbcdotcom.show() } /*]]>*/ </script> </div> </div> <div class="mpu-wrapper"> <div data-advert-groups="4" class="bbccom_slot" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="bbccom_advert bbccom_display_none"> <script type="text/javascript"> /*<![CDATA[*/ if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.slot) { bbcdotcom.slot('mpu', [4]); } /*]]>*/ </script> </div> <script type="text/javascript"> /*<![CDATA[*/ if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.show) { bbcdotcom.show() } /*]]>*/ </script> </div> </div> <div class="mpu-wrapper"> <div data-advert-groups="1_2_3_4" class="bbccom_slot" aria-hidden="true"> <div class="bbccom_advert bbccom_display_none"> <script type="text/javascript"> /*<![CDATA[*/ if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.slot) { bbcdotcom.slot('native_side', [1,2,3,4]); } /*]]>*/ </script> </div> <script type="text/javascript"> /*<![CDATA[*/ if (window.bbcdotcom && bbcdotcom.show) { bbcdotcom.show() } /*]]>*/ </script> </div> </div> <div id="" class="headed-section headed-section-related-stories"> <div class="headed-section-lining"> <header> <div class="section-header"> <div class="section-title-wrapper"> <h2 class="section-title">Related Stories</h2> </div> </div> </header> <div class="section-body"> <div class="headed-section-content"> <ul class="article-list article-list-related-stories "> <li class="promo-unit-wrapper"> <article> <div class="promo-unit "> <div class="promo-unit-lining"> <div data-brand="future" class="promo-unit-layout-standard "> <div class="promo-unit-image"> <div class="promo-unit-image-lining"> <a data-replace-url="/future/story/20150717-watch-how-a-cyborg-cockroach-is-created" data-anchor-title="(Credit: SPL)" data-caption="" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="false" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: SPL)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/130_73/images/live/p0/2x/bj/p02xbjkq.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-play"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--play"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: SPL) </a> </div> <div class="promo-unit-overlay"></div> </div> <div class="promo-unit-copy"> <div class="promo-unit-copy-lining"> <div class="promo-unit-header promo-unit-header-with-context"> <ul class="seperated-list context-heading-list"> <li class="seperated-list-item"> <span class="context-heading"> <a href="/future/columns/click" title="View Click"> Click</a> </span> </li> </ul> <a href="/future/story/20150717-watch-how-a-cyborg-cockroach-is-created"> <h3 class="promo-unit-title">Can cyborg cockroaches save lives?</h3> </a> </div> <p class="promo-unit-summary">Remote-controlled insects to the rescue</p> <ul class="link-box-list "> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </article> </li> <li class="promo-unit-wrapper"> <article> <div class="promo-unit "> <div class="promo-unit-lining"> <div data-brand="future" class="promo-unit-layout-standard "> <div class="promo-unit-image"> <div class="promo-unit-image-lining"> <a data-replace-url="/future/story/20150715-killer-robots-the-soldiers-that-never-sleep" data-anchor-title="What if a weapon like this could fire without a human controller?
