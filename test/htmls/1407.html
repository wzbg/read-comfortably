For an explanation of why this series is happening and how Musk is involved, </i><span class="s1"><i><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html" target="_blank">start with Part 1</a>.</i></span></p> <p>A Wait But Why post can be a few different things. One type of WBW post is the &#x201C;let&#x2019;s just take this whole topic and really actually get to the bottom of it so we can all completely get it from here forward.&#x201D; The ideal topic for that kind of post is one that&#x2019;s really important to our lives, and that tends to come up a lot, but that&#x2019;s also hugely complex and confusing, often controversial with differing information coming out of different mouths, and that ends up leaving a lot of people feeling like they don&#x2019;t totally get it as well as they &#x201C;should.&#x201D;</p> <p>The way I approach a post like that is I&#x2019;ll start with the surface of the topic and ask myself what I don&#x2019;t fully get&#x2014;I look for those foggy spots in the story where when someone mentions it or it comes up in an article I&#x2019;m reading, my mind kind of glazes over with a combination of &#x201C;ugh it&#x2019;s that icky term again nah go away&#x201D; and &#x201C;ew the adults are saying that adult thing again and I&#x2019;m seven so I don&#x2019;t actually understand what they&#x2019;re talking about.&#x201D; Then I&#x2019;ll get reading about those foggy spots&#x2014;but as I clear away fog from the surface, I often find more fog underneath. So then I research that new fog, and again, often come across other fog even further down. My perfectionism kicks in and I end up refusing to stop going down the rabbit hole until I hit the floor.</p> <p>For example, I kind of got the Iraq situation, but there was a lot of fog there too&#x2014;so when I wrote <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/09/muhammad-isis-iraqs-full-story.html" target="_blank">a post</a> about it, one fog-clearing rabbit hole took me all the way back to Muhammad in 570AD. That was the floor. Digging into another part of the story brought me to the end of World War I. Another brought me to the founding of ISIS.</p> <p>Hitting the floor is a great feeling and makes me realize that the adults weren&#x2019;t actually saying anything that complicated or icky after all. And when I come across that topic again, it&#x2019;s <em>fun </em>now, because I <em>get </em>it and I can nod with a serious face on and be like, &#x201C;Yes, interest rates are problematic&#x201D; like a real person.</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve heard people compare knowledge of a topic to a tree. If you don&#x2019;t fully get it, it&#x2019;s like a tree in your head with no trunk&#x2014;and without a trunk, when you learn something new about the topic&#x2014;a new branch or leaf of the tree&#x2014;there&#x2019;s nothing for it to hang onto, so it just falls away. By clearing out fog all the way to the bottom, I build a tree trunk in my head, and from then on, all new information can hold on, which makes that topic forever more interesting and productive to learn about. And what I usually find is that so many of the topics I&#x2019;ve pegged as &#x201C;boring&#x201D; in my head are actually just foggy to me&#x2014;like watching episode 17 of a great show, which would be boring if you didn&#x2019;t have the tree trunk of the back story and characters in place.</p> <p>So when it was time to start what I had labeled in my head as &#x201C;the Tesla post,&#x201D; I knew this was going to be one of those posts. To understand if and why Tesla Motors matters, you have to understand both the story of cars and the story of energy&#x2014;two worlds I somehow am simultaneously confused by and tremendously sick of. Just hearing someone say &#x201C;climate change&#x201D; or &#x201C;energy crisis&#x201D; or &#x201C;tailpipe emissions&#x201D; makes me kind of gag at this point&#x2014;just too much politics, too many annoying people, too much misinformation on all sides, and it&#x2019;s just hard to know how much I actually care and if there can be a solution to all of it anyway. So I did what I do when my tortoise shits when I&#x2019;m out of the apartment and then spends hours walking through it and tracking it across everything, including the walls somehow&#x2014;I rolled up my sleeves, took a deep breath, whispered, &#x201C;Be a man, Tim,&#x201D; and started scraping through layers of shit. If I have to live in a world with people arguing constantly about energy and oil and greenhouse gases and incentive programs, I might as well build myself a proper tree trunk.</p> <p>After weeks of reading and asking questions and writing, I&#x2019;ve emerged from the tortoise sewage with something that toes the line between a long blog post and a short book. I could have broken this into multiple posts, but it&#x2019;s all one story and I wanted to keep it all together. It&#x2019;ll be a bit of a time investment, but I think you&#x2019;ll come out of it with a sturdier tree trunk about all of this than you have now. And as it turns out, when it comes to this topic, we may be witnessing a very awesome moment in history without quite realizing it yet.</p> <p>Two disclaimers before we start:</p> <p>1) This is a highly politicized issue, but this post has no political agenda. I&#x2019;m not political because nothing could <em>ever possibly be more annoying </em>than American politics. I think both parties have good points, both also have a bunch of dumb people saying dumb things, and I want nothing to do with it. So I approached this post&#x2014;like I try to with every post&#x2014;from a standpoint of rationality and what I think makes sense.</p> <p>2) Spoiler: The post is very pro-Tesla. Which might seem suspicious since A) Elon Musk asked me to write about this and B) I just wrote a <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html" target="_blank">post</a> calling him the raddest possible man. But two things to keep in mind:</p> <p>First, this isn&#x2019;t commissioned by Musk, and I&#x2019;m being paid $0.00 for doing it. He suggested I take the issue on because I think he thinks there&#x2019;s a lack of full tree trunks in people&#x2019;s heads about it&#x2014;but he never suggested that I say good things about Tesla, electric cars, or anything else.</p> <p>Second, the currency Wait But Why lives on is integrity. Without it, WBW loses its ability to make an impact. And integrity came first here, even at the expense of Musk potentially hating me at the end of it, if that&#x2019;s what was necessary. If I didn&#x2019;t think this would have made a great WBW topic, I wouldn&#x2019;t have taken it on, and I&#x2019;m pro-Tesla in the post because after a ton of learning and thinking&#x2014;including as many counterarguments to Tesla and its worldview as I could find&#x2014;that&#x2019;s how I feel.</p> <p>And with that, let&#x2019;s dive in.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 20pt;">Contents</span></p> <p style="text-align: center;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> <a href="#part1">Part 1: The Story of Energy</a></span></strong><br> <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><a href="#part2">Part 2: The Story of Cars</a></span></strong><br> <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> <a href="#part3">Part 3: The Story of Tesla<br> </a></span></strong></p> <p style="text-align: center;">___________</p> <p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong><a name="part1"></a>Part 1: The Story of Energy</strong></span></p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Energy.png"><img class=" wp-image-3780 alignnone" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Energy.png" alt="Story of Energy" width="185" height="163"></a></p> <p>Energy is important. Without energy, we&#x2019;d all be like this:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lying-Down.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3751" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Lying-Down.png" alt="Lying Down" width="400" height="152"></a></p> <p>But what really is energy? The dictionary says it&#x2019;s &#x201C;the property of matter and radiation that is manifest as a capacity to perform work.&#x201D; And it says &#x201C;work&#x201D; is &#x201C;the exertion of force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change.&#x201D; Putting that together, we get energy being &#x201C;the property of matter and radiation that is manifest as a capacity to perform the exertion of force overcoming resistance or producing molecular change.&#x201D;</p> <p>That was pretty unfun, so for our purposes, let&#x2019;s call energy &#x201C;the thing that lets something do stuff.&#x201D;</p> <p>But the tricky thing about energy is the law of conservation of energy, which says that energy can&#x2019;t be created or destroyed, only transferred or transformed from one form to another. And since every living thing needs energy in order to do stuff&#x2014;and you can&#x2019;t make your own energy&#x2014;we&#x2019;re all awkwardly left with no choice but to steal the energy we need from someone else.<a href="#footnote-1-3667" id="note-1-3667" rel="footnote">1</a><a href="#footnote2-1-3667" id="note2-1-3667" rel="footnote2">1</a><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><sup>&#x2190; <span style="font-size: 10pt;">click these</span></sup></span></p> <p>Almost all of the energy used by the Earth&#x2019;s living things got to us in the first place from the sun.<a href="#footnote-2-3667" id="note-2-3667" rel="footnote">2</a> The sun&#x2019;s energy is what makes the wind blow and the rain fall and it&#x2019;s what powers the Earth&#x2019;s living things&#x2014;the biosphere.</p> <p>The joule is a common unit of energy&#x2014;defined as the amount of energy it takes to apply a force of one newton through a distance of one meter<a href="#footnote-3-3667" id="note-3-3667" rel="footnote">3</a>. While the sun&#x2019;s joules can provide any animal with heat and light, the joules that <em>power </em>all of us from the inside enter the biosphere in the first place when the sun gives them to plants.</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sun.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3785" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Sun.png" alt="Sun" width="341" height="347"></a></p> <p>That&#x2019;s how food is invented&#x2014;plants know how to take the sun&#x2019;s joules and turn them into food.</p> <p>At that point, all hell breaks loose as everyone starts murdering everyone else so they can steal their joules.</p> <p>We use &#x201C;the food chain&#x201D; as a cute euphemism for this murder/theft cycle, and we use the word &#x201C;eating&#x201D; to refer to &#x201C;stealing someone else&#x2019;s joules and also murdering them too.&#x201D; A &#x201C;predator&#x201D; is a dick who always seems to want <em>your </em>joules over everyone else&#x2019;s, and &#x201C;prey&#x201D; is just some sniveling nerd you particularly like to bully and steal lunch money from. Plants are the only innocent ones who actually follow the Golden Rule, but that&#x2019;s just because they have the privilege of having the sun as their sugar daddy&#x2014;and humans are the biosphere&#x2019;s upsetting mafia boss who just takes what he wants from anyone he wants, whenever he wants. It&#x2019;s not a great system, but it works.</p> <p>And that all went on normally for a while, but in the last few hundred thousand years, humans started to realize something: while it was enjoyable to put new joules into your body, actually <em>using</em> those joules sucked. It&#x2019;s much less fun to use a bunch of joules running fast or lifting something heavy than it is to just sit on a log pleasantly and hold onto those joules instead. So humans got clever and started to figure out ways to get joules<em> outside </em>their bodies to do work for them&#x2014;by doing that, humans could have their joules and eat them too. Sometimes the methods would be dickish:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Horse-hand.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3831" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Horse-hand.png" alt="Horse hand" width="500" height="344"></a></p> <p>But joules aren&#x2019;t only in living things. There are joules floating and swirling and zooming all around us, and by inventing the concept of <em>technology</em>, humans figured out ways to get use out of them. They made windmills that could steal some of the wind&#x2019;s joules as it went by and convert them into mechanical energy to grind food. They built sailboats that would convert wind joules into kinetic boat energy they could control. Water absorbs the sun&#x2019;s radiation joules and turns them into gravitational potential energy joules when it evaporates and then kinetic energy joules when it rains and slides down land, and humans saw the opportunity to snatch some of those up by creating water wheels or dams.</p> <p>But the most exciting joule-stealing technology humans came up with was figuring out how to <em>burn</em> something. With wind or water, you can only capture moving joules as they go by&#x2014;but when you burn something, you can take an object that has been soaking up joules for years and release them <em>all at once</em>. A joule explosion.</p> <p>They called this explosion fire, and because the joules that emerged were in the useful-to-humans formats of heat energy and light energy, burning things became a popular activity.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Taming a Dragon</strong></span></p> <p>We had learned to <em>harness </em>the joules of the wind and the water&#x2014;to take those forces by the reins and make them ours&#x2014;but when it came to the most joule-heavy force of all, fire, we couldn&#x2019;t really figure out how to do anything with it other than hang out near it, cook some stuff, and generally benefit from its existence. Fire was a hectic dragon and no one had figured out how to grab its reins.</p> <p>And then came the breakthrough. Steam.</p> <p>Fire joules were hard to harness, but if you sent them into water, they&#x2019;d get the water molecules to increasingly freak out and bounce around until finally those molecules would fully panic and start flying off the surface, evaporating upwards with the force of the raging fire below. You&#x2019;d have successfully converted the thermal energy joules of the fire&#x2014;which we didn&#x2019;t know how to directly harness&#x2014;into a powerful jet of steam we could control.</p> <p>With the muscle of steam in their toolkit, the inventors of the 18th century burst into innovation. They had some serious <em>joules </em>to work with now, which opened worlds of previously-unthinkable possibility. Breakthroughs led to more breakthroughs, and at the turn of the 19th century, the progress culminated in an invention that&#x2019;s often called the most impactful turning point in human history: the steam engine.</p> <p>Picture your tea kettle when it gets all angry at you and starts whistling. Now imagine that instead of the steam spewing out through the nozzle, you connected the nozzle to a tube, which directs the bursting steam into an empty cylinder and then finally releases it. When the steam goes into and then out of the cylinder, it shoves a &#x201C;piston&#x201D; inside the cylinder on a powerful back-and-forth motion. That&#x2019;s (a dramatic oversimplification of) how a steam engine works. Depending on the vehicle, the back-and-forth motion of the piston can do different things. In the example of a locomotive, the piston is attached to a rod whose back-and-forth motion turns the wheels:<a href="#footnote2-2-3667" id="note2-2-3667" rel="footnote2">2</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed.gif"><img class=" size-full wp-image-3681 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/rodsmed.gif" alt="rodsmed" width="549" height="168"></a></p> <p> </p> <p>Using the steam engine, humanity upgraded from sailboats to steamships and from animal-drawn carts to locomotives.<a href="#footnote-4-3667" id="note-4-3667" rel="footnote">4</a> Inside factories, people put steam to work too, swapping out their water wheels for much more effective steam-powered wheels.</p> <p>With the new ability to transport many more goods and materials, much farther away, much more quickly, and to far more efficient factories, the Industrial Revolution ignited in full force. People say the Industrial Revolution was powered by steam, but steam was just the middleman&#x2014;after hundreds of thousands of years of existing as passive benefactors of combustion, we had tamed the dragon, and the Industrial Revolution was powered by <em>fire.</em></p> <p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Striking Gold</strong></span></p> <p>The one thing about having made fire our bitch is that we now wanted to burn a lot more things than we ever had before. For most of human history, when people wanted to burn something, they just went and found some wood. Easy. Except now it was the 19th century, and with our new appetite to burn, wood wouldn&#x2019;t cut it anymore.</p> <p>We knew there were other things we could burn&#x2014;in Britain, they would often supplement wood by burning a black rocky substance they found on their shores. They called it coal.</p> <p>The problem is that unlike wood, most of the coal in Britain wasn&#x2019;t just sitting conveniently on land&#x2014;it was underground. When the Industrial Revolution got going, the British started digging&#x2014;they were gonna need a lot of coal. As the revolution spread through Europe and to North America, Europeans and Americans started digging too&#x2014;they also were gonna need a lot of coal.</p> <p>As everyone dug, they started finding other things too. They found pockets of burnable air we call natural gas and underground lakes of thick, black burnable liquid we call crude oil. It turns out that this whole time, humans had been walking around with a vast untapped treasure of tightly packed, burnable joules right underneath them. It was like a dog digging in the woods to bury a bone and uncovering an underground cave full of pulled pork.</p> <p>And what does a dog do who finds a cave of pulled pork? Does he pause to think cautiously about how to proceed or consider consequences for his health? No&#x2014;he eats the shit out of it. Mindlessly, at full speed.</p> <p>And throughout the 19th century, coal mines and oil rigs popped up everywhere. Burning this new treasure of joules made economies soar and the incentive to innovate soared along with them&#x2014;and new, fantastic technologies were born.</p> <p>Like steam engine technology, the credit for the electricity revolution is owed to a collaboration of dozens of innovators spanning centuries, but it was in the 1880s that it all finally came together. In what is still probably the most significant technological shift of all time, electricity allowed the raucous power of burning to be converted into a highly tame and remarkably versatile form of energy called electrical energy. With steam as a key middleman, all those spastic combustion joules could now be sent into an organized grid of wires, transferred long distances, and delivered into residential and commercial buildings where it would wait patiently in an outlet ready to be discharged at the user&#x2019;s convenience.<a href="#footnote-5-3667" id="note-5-3667" rel="footnote">5</a> At that point, the now electrical joules could be converted into almost any kind of energy&#x2014;they could boil water, freeze ice, light up the room, or make a phone call. If steam had tamed the dragon, electricity had turned the dragon into a magical butler, forever at our service. And for the first time in human history, the power was on.</p> <p>Right around the time this was happening, another revolution was underway. Fire was now powering our ships, our trains, our factories, and even the new wizardry of electricity, but individual transportation was still powered by hay like it was 1775&#x2014;and late 19th century humanity knew we could do better. Biological horses got super upset if you tried to power them by fire, so again, humanity got innovating, and a couple decades later, there were big, metal, horses everywhere with engine cylinders full of fire.</p> <p>As coal, oil, and natural gas motivated unprecedented innovation, the resulting waves of new technologies created an unprecedented need to burn stuff&#x2014;which motivated the diggers. Companies that focused on digging, sucking, and siphoning up more and more of our underground joule treasure, like John D. Rockefeller&#x2019;s Standard Oil, became the world&#x2019;s biggest corporate empires. It was a new world, powered by an endless cave of pulled pork, being gorged upon by the world&#x2019;s happiest dog&#x2026;</p> <p style="text-align: center;">___________</p> <p>Flash forward to the present day.</p> <p>Burning our bounty of underground joule-packed fuel to power our world is now an innovation more than two centuries old&#x2014;but in 2015, it&#x2019;s still the main way humans get their power:<a href="#footnote2-3-3667" id="note2-3-3667" rel="footnote2">3</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3729" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013.png" alt="Total_World_Energy_Consumption_by_Source_2013" width="600" height="298"></a></p> <p>That&#x2019;s the thing about dogs&#x2014;if given something delicious, they tend to eat until the food runs out or they get sick, whichever comes first, and there aren&#x2019;t too many other factors in play. The modern energy debate essentially boils down to whether it&#x2019;s okay that the dog is still fully enjoying himself in the cave or whether it&#x2019;s not because he might be making himself dangerously sick or risk running out of pulled pork&#x2014;which would be a problem, because he has grown increasingly large since finding the cave, and he has no way outside the cave of feeding his now-immense appetite.</p> <p>As you might have noticed, there are a lot of people who have a lot of opinions for a lot of reasons saying a lot of things about this situation. And some are saying real things, but a large portion of them either don&#x2019;t especially know what they&#x2019;re talking about or they have some ulterior motive for saying what they&#x2019;re saying. This makes an already complex, murky, multi-faceted topic even more confusing.</p> <p>So let&#x2019;s lay out what we do know and try to clarify what the hell is really going on.</p> <p>To begin with&#x2014;what exactly are fossil fuels and where do they come from?</p> <p>Fossil fuels are called fossil fuels because they&#x2019;re the remains of ancient living things. &#x201C;Ancient&#x201D; in this case spans a wide range. The earliest organisms that contribute to today&#x2019;s fossil fuels lived during the Precambrian Eon, before there were any plants and animals on land&#x2014;the fossil organisms then would have been ocean algae. People often think fossil fuels are made of dinosaurs, but any dinosaurs in our gasoline are from the last couple hundred million years&#x2014;the later stretch of the timespan&#x2014;and only a small contributor. The largest portion of our fossil fuels comes from plants, animals, and algae that lived during the Carboniferous Period&#x2014;a 50 million year period that ended about 300 million years ago and during which there were lots of huge, shallow swamps. The swamps were important because it made it more likely that a dead organism would be preserved. You don&#x2019;t become a fossil fuel if you die in a normal place and decompose away. But by dying in a swamp and sinking to the bottom, Carboniferous organisms often ended up being quickly covered by sand and clay and were able to make it underground with their joules still intact.</p> <p>After hundreds of millions of years, all those organisms were squashed under intense heat and pressure and became converted into joule-dense solid, liquid, or gas&#x2014;coal, oil, and natural gas. Quick blue box brush-up:</p> <div class="wbwAside"> <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Fossil Fuels Brush-Up</strong></span></p> <p><strong>Coal</strong>, a black sedimentary rock that&#x2019;s found in underground layers called coal beds, is the cheapest and most plentiful of the three and is used almost entirely for making electricity. It&#x2019;s also the worst culprit for CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, releasing about 30% more CO<sub>2</sub> than the burning of oil and about double that of natural gas when generating an equivalent amount of heat.<a href="#footnote2-4-3667" id="note2-4-3667" rel="footnote2">4</a> The US is to coal as Saudi Arabia is to oil, possessing 22% of the world&#x2019;s coal, the most of any nation. China, though, has become by far the world&#x2019;s largest consumer of coal&#x2014;over <em>half </em>of the coal burned in the world in recent years was burned in China.<a href="#footnote2-5-3667" id="note2-5-3667" rel="footnote2">5</a> </p><p><strong>Oil</strong>, also known as crude oil or petroleum, is a gooey black liquid normally found in deep underground reservoirs. When crude oil is extracted, it heads to the refinery, where it&#x2019;s separated, using different boiling points, into a bunch of different things. Here&#x2019;s how a typical barrel of US oil was broken down in 2014:<a href="#footnote2-6-3667" id="note2-6-3667" rel="footnote2">6</a> <ul> <li class="p1">44.9% gas for cars</li> <li class="p1">29.8% heating oil and diesel fuels</li> <li class="p1">13.8% other products like wax, synthetic rubber, and plastics</li> <li class="p1">9.5% jet fuel (kerosene)</li> <li class="p1">2.0% asphalt</li> </ul> </p><p>The United States is by far the biggest consumer of oil in the world, consuming over 20% of the world&#x2019;s oil and about double the next biggest consumer. The US is also one of the three biggest oil producers in the world, alongside Saudi Arabia and Russia, who all produce roughly the same amount.<a href="#footnote-6-3667" id="note-6-3667" rel="footnote">6</a> </p><p><strong>Natural gas</strong>, which is formed when underground oil gets to a super-high temperature and vaporizes, is found in underground pockets, usually in the vicinity of oil reserves. The &#x201C;cleanest&#x201D; of the three fossil fuels, it&#x2019;s the gas that fires up your stove or heats your apartment (if those aren&#x2019;t electricity-powered or heated by oil), and it&#x2019;s one of the major sources of electricity (it makes up about 20% of electricity in the US). Natural gas is on the rise and now makes up almost a quarter of the world&#x2019;s energy. One of the reasons it&#x2019;s on the rise is that scientists have found a new way of extracting natural gas from the Earth called hydraulic fracturing, or &#x201C;fracking,&#x201D; which uses a mixture of water, sand, and chemicals to create cracks in natural gas-rich shale and force out the gas. This method has been hugely effective, but it&#x2019;s also controversial because of some serious environmental concerns&#x2014;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uti2niW2BRA" target="_blank">this video</a> explains it well.</p> </div> <p>As for the reasons people argue that fossil fuels are problematic, we&#x2019;re going to focus on the two most common&#x2014;</p> <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>ISSUE 1: Climate Change is a Thing</strong></span></p> <p>Let&#x2019;s ignore all the politicians and professors and CEOs and filmmakers and look at three facts:</p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Fact 1) Burning Fossil Fuels Makes Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Rise</strong></span></p> <p>We&#x2019;ll get to the data in a second, but first&#x2014;why does burning fossil fuels emit CO<sub>2</sub>?</p> <p>The answer is simple: <strong>combustion is reverse photosynthesis.</strong></p> <p>When a plant grows, it makes its own food through photosynthesis. At its most oversimplified, during photosynthesis, the plant takes CO<sub>2</sub> from the air<a href="#footnote-7-3667" id="note-7-3667" rel="footnote">7</a> and absorbs light energy from the sun to split the CO<sub>2</sub> into carbon (C) and oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>). The plant keeps the carbon and emits the oxygen as a waste product. The sun&#x2019;s light energy stays in the plant as chemical energy the plant can use.</p> <p>So wood is essentially a block of carbon and stored chemical energy.</p> <p>When you burn a log, all you&#x2019;re doing is reversing the photosynthesis. Normally, oxygen in the air just bounces off carbon molecules in wood&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why trees aren&#x2019;t constantly on fire. But when an oxygen molecule gets moving fast enough and <em>smashes </em>into a log&#x2019;s carbon molecule, they <em>snap</em> together and the oxygen and carbon are reunited again as CO<sub>2</sub>. This snapping releases chemical energy, which knocks into other nearby oxygen molecules, causing <em>them </em>to get going fast&#x2014;and if they get going fast enough, they&#x2019;ll snap together with another of the log&#x2019;s carbon molecules, which releases <em>more</em> chemical energy. This causes a chain reaction, and the log is now on fire. So a log burning is the process of the carbon in the log combining with oxygen in the air and floating off as CO<sub>2</sub>.</p> <p>Of course, that&#x2019;s all irrelevant to the person burning the log&#x2014;what <em>they </em>care about is the <em>energy </em>released during all of this CO<sub>2 </sub>formation. The release of all of the log&#x2019;s stored chemical energy creates a glorious blaze of heat and light. The tree spent years quietly absorbing carbon<sub> </sub>molecules and sunshine joules, and all at once, during combustion, that carbon and sunshine explode back out into the world.<a href="#footnote-8-3667" id="note-8-3667" rel="footnote">8</a> </p><p>To put it another way, photosynthesis just kidnaps carbon and sun energy out of the atmosphere, and after years of holding them hostage, combustion sets them both free&#x2014;the carbon as a billowing eruption of newly reunited CO<sub>2</sub>, and the sun energy as fire&#x2014;meaning that fire is essentially just tightly packed sunshine.</p> <p>But burning a log and releasing all that CO<sub>2 </sub>does <em>not </em>tamper with the atmosphere&#x2019;s carbon levels. Why? Because the carbon that&#x2019;s being released was recently <em>in</em> the atmosphere, and if you hadn&#x2019;t set the log on fire, it would have likely decomposed, which would release the carbon back into the world anyway. The log&#x2019;s carbon was only being held <em>temporarily</em> hostage, and releasing it through combustion has little effect.</p> <p>Carbon flows from the atmosphere into plants and animals, into the ground and water, and then back out of all those things into the atmosphere&#x2014;that&#x2019;s called the carbon cycle. At any given point in time, the Earth&#x2019;s active carbon cycle contains a specific amount of carbon. Burning a log doesn&#x2019;t change that level because the carbon cycle &#x201C;expects&#x201D; that carbon to be hanging around the ground, water, or air.</p> <p>But sometimes, a small portion of carbon in the cycle drops <em>out </em>of the cycle for the long term&#x2014;it happens when a plant or animal dies but for some reason <em>doesn&#x2019;t </em>decay normally. Instead, before it can decay and release its carbon back into the cycle, it&#x2019;s buried underground. Over time, that lost carbon adds up. And today, the Earth&#x2019;s fossil fuels make up a huge mass of lost carbon&#x2014;carbon that long ago was taken hostage <em>permanently</em>, and carbon that the carbon cycle does <em>not </em>expect to be involved in its routine.</p> <p>When humans discovered all of this underground kidnapped carbon, you have to remember that for them, the carbon wasn&#x2019;t the point. They were staring at an endless sea of 300 million-year-old, densely packed sunshine&#x2014;trillions of ancient plants with their <em>joules</em><em> intact</em>&#x2014;and since there are no laws protecting the estates of Carboniferous plants, we could seize it all for ourselves. The grandest joule theft in history.</p> <p>And as we helped ourselves, we didn&#x2019;t worry about the fact that extracting those joules also meant extracting carbon that had been buried as far back as the Precambrian period&#x2014;there were locomotives to fuel and cars to power and buildings to heat, and the joules were irresistible.</p> <p>And those joules have gone a long way&#x2014;you can thank them for the comforts and quality of your life today. But those carbon molecules have gone a long way too.</p> <p>Starting in 1958, scientist Charles Keeling started measuring atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels from an observatory on Mauna Loa in Hawaii. Those measurements are still going on today. Here&#x2019;s what they show:<a href="#footnote2-7-3667" id="note2-7-3667" rel="footnote2">7</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg_.png"><img class="  wp-image-3790 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg_.png" alt="Mauna_Loa_CO2_monthly_mean_concentration.svg" width="475" height="475"></a></p> <p>The zig-zaggy motion of the line is due to the level falling each year in the summer when plants are sucking up CO<sub>2</sub> and rising up again during the winter when the leaves are dead. But the overarching trend is unmistakable. To put that into context, ice drilling technology<a href="#footnote-9-3667" id="note-9-3667" rel="footnote">9</a> allows scientists to collect accurate data on what CO<sub>2</sub> levels have been throughout the last 400,000 years. Here&#x2019;s what they&#x2019;ve found:<a href="#footnote2-8-3667" id="note2-8-3667" rel="footnote2">8</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/co2_variations.png"><img class=" size-full wp-image-3707 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/co2_variations.png" alt="co2_variations" width="500" height="363"></a></p> <p>So atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels have oscillated<a href="#footnote-10-3667" id="note-10-3667" rel="footnote">10</a> between about 180 and 300 parts per million over the last 400,000 years, never eclipsing 300, and suddenly in the last century the level has vaulted up to 400 (it&#x2019;s <a href="http://co2now.org/" target="_blank">currently</a> at 403ppm).</p> <p>So instead of the atmosphere being .02% or .03% carbon, it&#x2019;s now .04% carbon and maybe moving towards .05% and higher. But let&#x2019;s not judge anything yet. All we know is Fact #1, which tells us that CO<sub>2</sub> levels are rising quickly.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Fact 2) Where Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Levels Go, Temperatures Follow</strong></span></p> <p>The ice cores dug up by scientists don&#x2019;t just reveal the CO<sub>2</sub> levels going backwards in time&#x2014;they reveal temperature too. Here&#x2019;s what they show:<a href="#footnote2-9-3667" id="note2-9-3667" rel="footnote2">9</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-graph.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3812" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-graph.png" alt="temp graph" width="538" height="268"></a></p> <p>Not a hard correlation to see. The reason for this is simple&#x2014;CO<sub>2</sub> is a greenhouse gas. The way an actual greenhouse works is the glass lets in sun energy and traps a lot of it inside as heat. There are a handful of chemicals in our atmosphere that do the same thing&#x2014;sun rays come in, bounce off the Earth, and they&#x2019;re on their way out when the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere block some of them and spread them through the atmosphere, warming things up.</p> <p>Mars has an average temperature of -55&#xBA;C (-67&#xBA;F), which isn&#x2019;t fun, but Venus is literally actual hell, with an average temperature of 462&#xBA;C (864&#xBA;F). No one is more of a dick than Venus. Why? CO<sub>2</sub>. Mars has a much thinner atmosphere than Earth so the sun&#x2019;s energy easily escapes, while Venus&#x2019;s atmosphere is much thicker, with <em>300 times</em> the CO<sub>2</sub> as Earth, so it traps in a ton of heat. Mercury is <em>closer</em> to the sun than Venus, but with no atmosphere, it&#x2019;s cooler than Venus. During the day, Mercury gets almost as hot as Venus, but at night it gets freezing, while Venus is just as hot at night as it is during the day, because the heat lives permanently in its thick atmosphere.</p> <p>So it makes sense that an increase in CO<sub>2</sub> here would increase temperature&#x2014;but by how much? When compared to the Pre-Industrial average temperature, our current average temperature has risen by a little less than 1&#xBA;C. But as CO<sub>2 </sub>levels keep rising, most scientists expect temperatures to keep rising. The UN-supported Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from a bunch of different countries, came out with <a href="http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/syr/ar4_syr_spm.pdf" target="_blank">a report</a> that laid out the temperature projections of a number of independent labs. This is what those labs think will happen if no action is taken to alter the current trends in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions:<a href="#footnote2-10-3667" id="note2-10-3667" rel="footnote2">10</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Global_Warming_Predictions.png"><img class="  wp-image-3715 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Global_Warming_Predictions.png" alt="Global_Warming_Predictions" width="398" height="284"></a></p> <p>A small minority argue that these future projections are overblown&#x2014;they <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/fossil-fuels-will-save-the-world-really-1426282420" target="_blank">point out</a> that they ride on the largely accepted theory that water vapor in the atmosphere multiplies the effect of carbon emissions because of a &#x201C;feedback&#x201D; loop, whereby a small increase in temperature from extra CO<sub>2 </sub>increases water evaporation, and since water vapor is also a greenhouse gas, that creates more warmth, which further increases more evaporation, and on and on. Without this feedback loop, the temperature increases resulting from CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions would be 2-3 times smaller. But even the greatest skeptics usually agree that CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions do lead to temperature increases.</p> <p>The IPCC also puts it at over 90% that the changes in both CO<sub>2 </sub>levels and temperature are caused by human activity (which is kind of like saying there&#x2019;s over a 90% chance that a rain storm has been caused by cloud activity). Now the question becomes&#x2014;how much does the temperature need to change to make everything shitty?</p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Fact 3) The Temperature Doesn&#x2019;t Need to Change Very Much to Make Everything Shitty</strong></span></p> <p>18,000 years ago, global temperatures were about 5&#xBA;C lower than the 20th century average. That was enough to put Canada, Scandinavia, and half of England and the US under a half a mile of ice. That&#x2019;s what 5&#xBA;C can do.<a href="#footnote2-11-3667" id="note2-11-3667" rel="footnote2">11</a> </p><p><img class=" size-full wp-image-3702 aligncenter" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/gif" alt="" width="550" height="210"></p> <p>100 million years ago, temperatures were 6-10&#xBA;C higher than they are now&#x2014;and every region of the Earth was tropical, there was no permanent ice anywhere, ocean levels were <a href="http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/142729/Cretaceous-Period" target="_blank">200 meters</a> higher, and this kind of shit was happening:<a href="#footnote2-12-3667" id="note2-12-3667" rel="footnote2">12</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/T-rex-120501.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3810" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/T-rex-120501.jpg" alt="T-rex-120501" width="297" height="327"></a></p> <p>So we&#x2019;re currently in this not-that-big window we probably should try to stay in:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/temp-spectrum.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3763" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/temp-spectrum.png" alt="temp spectrum" width="647" height="303"></a></p> <p>This is also even more fragile than is intuitive. First, you don&#x2019;t need the <em>average</em> temperature to go up by a catastrophic amount to have a catastrophe&#x2014;because the average temp could go up by only 3&#xBA;C but the <em>max </em>temp rises by a lot more. Just <em>one day</em> at an outlier high like 58&#xBA;C (136&#xBA;F) would wipe out most of the Earth&#x2019;s crops and animals. Second, because the total range of temperature a planet can be goes all the way down to absolute zero: -273&#xBA;C (-459&#xBA;F). So a difference of 5&#xBA;C, enough to bury the northern part of the world under an ocean of ice, is really only about a 1.5% fluctuation in temperature&#x2014;not something like 10%, which is what it seems like. Looking at the window on a spectrum that shows the full range emphasizes that the world we&#x2019;re used to is what it is only because of a very specific and delicate balance of conditions.</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-spectrum-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3782" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/temp-spectrum-2.png" alt="temp spectrum 2" width="683" height="255"></a></p> <p>As mentioned above, right now, the average temp is edging upwards to 1&#xBA;C above the Pre-Industrial norm (the IPCC <a href="http://www.climatechange2013.org/" target="_blank">puts us</a> at +.86&#xBA;C currently). Scientists debate how high that number can go before really dramatic changes start to happen. For the last 20 years, <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7242/full/nature08017.html" target="_blank">over 100 countries</a> have agreed to try to limit global warming to a 2&#xBA;C increase, but there are all of these different opinions going around about that. Regarding the effects of a 2&#xBA;C increase, in my research, I came across some credible sources saying 2&#xBA; is an unnecessarily low ceiling and that that we can afford to safely go higher and others saying that 2&#xBA; is <em>too</em> high a target and that we&#x2019;re underestimating how catastrophic a change of 2&#xBA; would be. Regarding our ability to stay under 2&#xBA;, I&#x2019;ve also heard varying opinions&#x2014;some think we can stay under 2&#xBA; with proper restrictions; others think there&#x2019;s no possible way we can stay under 2&#xBA;&#x2014;that there&#x2019;s enough upward momentum already that even if we stopped creating carbon emissions in the next few years, the Earth would keep warming past 2&#xBA;.</p> <p>So what are we supposed to make of this?</p> <p>Our goal today is <em>not </em>to dig deep into these conflicting opinions and try to figure out the truth, because no one knows for sure anyway. We&#x2019;re not going to talk about specific things like sea levels, pollution, storms, or that polar bear in the video who&#x2019;s extra sad because his ice is melting. We&#x2019;re just going to take our three facts and put them all together and see what happens:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3783" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel.png" alt="Cancel" width="686" height="182"></a></p> <p>This simplifies down to:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3784" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Cancel-2.png" alt="Cancel 2" width="500" height="62"></a></p> <p>Interesting. But let&#x2019;s not ostracize the skeptics. We can massage it into a statement that leaves plenty of room for doubt:</p> <p><strong>If we continue to burn fossil fuels as much as we are, things might get really shitty kind of soon.</strong></p> <p>With this in mind, let&#x2019;s now move on to the second major concern people cite regarding fossil fuels:</p> <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><b>ISSUE 2: Fossil Fuels Are Endful</b></span></p> <p>A couple times so far, I&#x2019;ve referred to our fossil fuels supply, that succulent underground sea of dense energy, as &#x201C;endless&#x201D;&#x2014;because that&#x2019;s how it seemed in the 19th century and how it often seems today when you realize how much of it is still underground waiting to be tapped. But actually, the Earth&#x2019;s fossil fuel supply is not endless&#x2014;it&#x2019;s endful.</p> <p><em>When </em>we run out is a complicated and hazy question.

Those sources suggest we&#x2019;re unlikely to run out of fossil fuels for many centuries. A common counter to those sources is that even without running out, we could face a serious problem if the extraction of the fuels becomes more and more difficult and expensive over time.</p> <p>The problem with running out, whenever it happens, is that if the world is anywhere near as reliant on fossil fuels at that point as we are now, it&#x2019;ll cause an epic economic collapse. As fossil fuels grow more and more scarce, prices will skyrocket. That will cause a furious rush to develop renewable energy technology, but it may be too late at that point to prevent a worldwide economic meltdown.</p> <p>Basically, we&#x2019;re currently living off of a trust fund we found underground, and we&#x2019;d better learn how to get a job before it runs out.</p> <p>For our sum-up for this section, how about:</p> <p><strong>At some point in the future, either really soon or just a little soon, we&#x2019;ll have no choice but to stop running everything on fossil fuels, because they&#x2019;ll either be gone or too expensive.</strong></p> <p>This statement highlights the fact that we&#x2019;re very much in what will be known as the Fossil Fuel Era of human history.</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FF-Timeline.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3766" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FF-Timeline.png" alt="FF Timeline" width="700" height="221"></a></p> <p>Bringing back our first statement&#x2014;<em>if we continue to burn fossil fuels as much as we are, things might get really shitty kind of soon</em>&#x2014;suggests that if we continue to dick around in the black zone until we&#x2019;re forced out by short supply, we&#x2019;re risking <em>making the yellow zone permanently worse for humans to exist in. </em></p> <p>This is why Elon Musk likes to say that the indefinite extension of the Fossil Fuels Era is &#x201C;the dumbest experiment in history.&#x201D; He emphasized this point to me: &#x201C;The greater the change to the chemical composition of the physical, chemical makeup of the oceans and atmosphere [due to increased carbon emissions], the greater the long-term effect will be. Given that at some point they&#x2019;ll run out anyway, why run this crazy experiment to see how bad it&#x2019;ll be? We know it&#x2019;s at least some bad, and the overwhelming scientific consensus is that it&#x2019;ll be really bad.&#x201D;</p> <p>In other words, as it relates to the above timeline&#x2014;<em>there&#x2019;s potentially huge long-term downside to staying in the black area for too long, so let&#x2019;s just get ourselves to the yellow part as soon as we can. </em>Some skeptics I read made what seemed like very valid points, but even most skeptics agreed that burning of fossil fuels causes <em>some </em>degree of warming and that warming <em>might </em>turn out to be harmful. And even if we view this as a genuine debate&#x2014;when one possibility is &#x201C;turns out burning fossil fuels wasn&#x2019;t actually dangerous&#x201D; and the other side is &#x201C;turns out burning fossil fuels was horribly catastrophic,&#x201D; don&#x2019;t we want to play it safe??</p> <p>So how do we get from the black to the yellow?</p> <p>To help us answer that question, let&#x2019;s turn to the <a href="https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/international/2007EnergyInternational.pdf" target="_blank">Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory</a> and their useful energy charts. They update the US flowchart every year, and we&#x2019;ll get there in a minute, but first, let&#x2019;s check out some of the charts from their <a href="https://flowcharts.llnl.gov/content/international/2007EnergyInternational.pdf" target="_blank">2011 report</a>, where they have a flow chart for every country and the world as a whole for the year 2007.

Some thoughts:</p> <p>&#x2013; The most consistent fact I noticed about all countries is how much petroleum (i.e. crude oil) dominates the transportation sector. 94% of the world&#x2019;s transportation runs on oil, and in most developed countries, the percentage is even higher.</p> <p>&#x2013; Biomass use is pretty substantial, and almost all of it comes from developing countries, many of them in Africa. Biomass is typically the burning of things like wood, oil distilled down from food like corn, and manure.</p> <p>&#x2013; That&#x2019;s a whole lot of rejected energy on the right side. Rejected energy is energy we lose, usually in the form of heat, due to inefficiency. Especially unimpressive is the transportation performance, where engines only end up using a quarter of the fuel they burn.</p> <p>Next, let&#x2019;s look at<strong> France:</strong></p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/France-2007-copy-compressor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3803" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/France-2007-copy-compressor.jpg" alt="France-2007-copy-compressor" width="900" height="603"></a><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/France-2007.png"><br> </a><br> Thoughts:</p> <p>&#x2013; Lots of nuclear, and as a result, very little coal. That makes France a pretty light CO<sub>2</sub> emitter.</p> <p>&#x2013; Their transportation, though, is like everyone else&#x2019;s&#x2014;running on oil.</p> <p>&#x2013; France is an example of a factor we&#x2019;re not going to discuss in this post, but an important one: <strong>fossil fuels are a bit of a geopolitical nightmare</strong>. Nation interdependence can be productive and important, but nations being dependent on other nations for their <em>survival</em> is never a great thing, and the need to import fossil fuels is one of the major reasons for modern nation ultra-dependency. France is totally reliant on oil for its transportation and totally reliant on other countries for oil&#x2014;this puts them in a vulnerable position. The US isn&#x2019;t as dependent. It relied on other nations for 60% of its oil a decade ago but has since become one of the top three oil-producing countries, and the EIA <a href="http://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/" target="_blank">projects</a> net oil imports to make up only 21% of the US&#x2019;s 2015 oil consumption. I was also surprised <a href="http://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/pet_move_impcus_a2_nus_ep00_im0_mbbl_m.htm" target="_blank">to see</a> that only a small portion of US oil imports were from the Middle East, with only 12.5% of them coming from Saudi Arabia and 20% from the entire combined Persian Gulf.

The LLNL also produces a chart showing the US carbon emissions and where they come from. The US is the world&#x2019;s <a href="http://www.eia.gov/cfapps/ipdbproject/iedindex3.cfm?tid=90&amp;pid=44&amp;aid=8" target="_blank">second biggest</a> carbon emissions culprit (China is first with 50% more than the US) and the world leader in transportation emissions&#x2014;so if we can figure out what the US needs to fix, that&#x2019;s a good start.</p> <p>Getting from the black to the yellow means getting rid of carbon emissions. Looking at the US emissions flowchart, I see two glaring numbers:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-Emissions-2013-compressor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3799" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/US-Emissions-2013-compressor.jpg" alt="US-Emissions-2013-compressor" width="900" height="594"></a></p> <p>There are many things that need to happen to get us into the yellow zone, but these two figures&#x2014;which make up 72% of total US emissions&#x2014;seem like the biggest and most urgent problems to address:</p> <p>1) Electricity production throughout the world makes up about 40% of the total energy flow, and roughly two thirds of electricity production comes from burning carbon-emitting fossil fuels, most prominently coal. Or, put simply: <strong>Electricity production is huge and mostly dirty.</strong></p> <p>2) Transportation makes up a large chunk of the world&#x2019;s energy flow, including near a third in most developed countries, and almost all the world&#x2019;s transportation runs on petroleum. Put simply: <strong>Transportation is huge and almost entirely dirty.</strong></p> <p>We&#x2019;ve spent this post zoomed far out on all of this. Now it&#x2019;s time to zoom in, and we&#x2019;ll zoom in on the second major problem listed above&#x2014;transportation, and in particular, cars. Transportation covers planes, trains, ships, trucks, and cars&#x2014;but cars cause more carbon emissions than the other four combined, and without major changes, car emissions are <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=7&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=0CEcQFjAG&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mckinsey.com%2F~%2Fmedia%2FMcKinsey%2Fdotcom%2Fclient_service%2FSustainability%2FPDFs%2Froads_toward_low_carbon_future_new.ashx&amp;ei=YbRbVbKpHpDZgwTv1oHgCg&amp;usg=AFQjCNG3SEeN0mjEnhTVGWEcgP3FFGFzDg&amp;sig2=Ycq_mTE6XiZBtnFhiqOB0Q" target="_blank">expected</a> to rise by over 50% by 2030.

Edison&#x2019;s company was busy rolling out electrical generating systems to power US cities, and working on these, Ford got good at working with the steam-powered engines the company used to make electricity. In his spare time, Ford sat in a little workshop next to his home playing around with the still-novel concept of the internal combustion engine, and in 1896, at the age of 32, he came up with what he called the Ford Quadricycle, powered by a simple internal combustion engine.<a href="#footnote2-24-3667" id="note2-24-3667" rel="footnote2">24</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FordQuadricycle-compressor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3822" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/FordQuadricycle-compressor.jpg" alt="FordQuadricycle-compressor" width="500" height="405"></a></p> <p>Becoming increasingly obsessed with building self-propelled vehicles, Ford quit his job in 1899 and first formed the Detroit Automobile Company, which failed, before forming the Henry Ford company in 1901. But Ford soon left the company over a dispute with the company&#x2019;s investors, who then renamed it Cadillac Automobile Company, and in 1903, he went on to partner with a guy named Alexander Malcomson to create a company called Ford &amp; Malcomson, Ltd., which was later renamed Ford Motor Company. Super annoying for Malcomson.</p> <p>Ford and his new company charged ahead making gas-powered cars, but at the time, gas cars were hardly the norm. Cars were a new technology, and at the beginning of the century, 40% of American cars were powered by steam and 38% were electric&#x2014;gas cars only made up 22% of the American market.</p> <p>These numbers make sense. Steam-centered external combustion was the older and best-understood technology of the three and was initially the most common way to power a car. Its fancier new cousin, the internal combustion engine, powered by burning gasoline, cut out the middleman and burned fuel more efficiently. But it&#x2019;s no surprise that the quickest up-and-comer type of car was the electric car. It was 1900 and electricity was at the core of all the coolest, newest technology.</p> <p>The 35 years between the mid-1860s and the turn of the century had just witnessed an electricity revolution, driven by inventors like Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, Alexander Graham Bell, and George Westinghouse, during which the world went from normal to positively <em>magical</em>. The first magic happened in the middle of the century, when the telegraph used long-range electricity to communicate with people really far away, and in 1866, the first successful cross-Atlantic telegraph message was sent, allowing Europe and the US to magically communicate with each other <em>instantly</em>. The magic revolution hit full force in the late 1870s. The first telephone call happened in 1876, followed by the first time in human history someone could record sound and then play it back, in 1877. Light bulbs began to light up city streets in the early 1880s, and by 1896, the first electrical grid brought widespread electricity into people&#x2019;s homes. Also in 1896, the first primitive motion picture went on display in New York, and the first wireless transmission of a human voice&#x2014;the birth of the radio&#x2014;went through in Brazil in 1900. Meanwhile, magical horseless cars were appearing on the streets, and only a few years later, in 1903, the Wright Brothers would take humanity&#x2019;s first heavier-than-air flight. It&#x2019;s hard to imagine how <i>insanely cool </i>a time this must have been for everyone.</p> <p>And if you were alive around the year 1900, you&#x2019;d probably equate modern tech with electricity, much the way we today equate modern tech with computers, smart phones and the internet. Edison and Tesla were their Bill Gates and Steve Jobs. The idea of powering transportation with a fiery engine dated back to the earliest locomotives almost 100 years earlier, which would seem about as modern to a person in 1900 as black-and-white silent films seem to us today. By 1900, you weren&#x2019;t supposed to have to deal with how the energy sausage is really made anymore&#x2014;the burning fire happened in some remote generator now, allowing consumers to only have to interact with the silent, clean, convenient magical butler&#x2014;electricity.</p> <p>So if someone in the year 1900 had to bet on the outcome of the battle between external steam combustion, internal gasoline combustion, and electricity as the future standard for powering cars, they&#x2019;d have probably put their money on electricity. And at the time, electricity was not only winning the battle over gasoline with far more cars on the road, but the world&#x2019;s most prominent inventors, including Edison and Tesla, were pouring their efforts into an electric car future. Early in the century, the New York Times referred to the electric car as &#x201C;ideal,&#x201D; citing it as quieter, cleaner, and more economical than the gas car.<a href="#footnote2-25-3667" id="note2-25-3667" rel="footnote2">25</a> </p><p>But <em>ideal</em> wasn&#x2019;t the driving force of the early auto industry&#x2014;<em>scalable</em> was. Cars were, up until that point, fairly impractical toys for rich people. There would be time to idealize everything later&#x2014;the first step was to figure out how to make the car fast, sturdy, and most importantly, affordable. Money and brains poured into car technology from all over the world, and in 1908, Henry Ford and his five-year-old company came out with the car that launched the automotive industry into the stratosphere: The Model T.<a href="#footnote2-26-3667" id="note2-26-3667" rel="footnote2">26</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1908-model-t-ford.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-3737 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/1908-model-t-ford.jpg" alt="1908-model-t-ford" width="491" height="368"></a></p> <p>Before the Model T, there had been big problems with both electric and gas vehicles. Electric had shorter ranges and longer refueling times. Gas cars were loud, hard to start, and spewed smoke like it was 1802.</p> <p>But Ford was a masterful industrialist, and by coming up with the concept of making cars by moving assembly line instead of hand-crafting them, he dramatically brought down costs and created America&#x2019;s first car for the masses. In 1912, engineer Charles Kettering invented the electric car starter, eliminating the need to laboriously and dangerously hand crank your gas car on, and the newly invented muffler significantly reduced gas engine noise. Suddenly, a lot of the things that sucked about gas cars didn&#x2019;t suck anymore&#x2014;and they had become much cheaper than electric cars. Ford&#x2019;s Model T took over America, and by 1914, 99% of new American cars ran on gas. By 1920, electric cars dropped entirely out of commercial production.<a href="#footnote2-27-3667" id="note2-27-3667" rel="footnote2">27</a> </p><p>This was not an inevitable outcome. The future of cars had been up for grabs, and Ford had simply outsmarted his competition. Burning fuel was the way of the past and electricity was the way of the future&#x2014;but Ford had created a provable, profitable business model for making cars, one that didn&#x2019;t yet exist for electric cars, and it quickly became too much of an uphill battle for electric car makers to try to turn the tide. So they stopped.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">___________</p> <p>Now it&#x2019;s a century later. The most primitive local telephone call through a wire has become a person in Delhi being able to take a slab of glass out of his pocket, tap it with his finger, and instantly be talking to, and looking at, his friend in Sao Paulo. The grainiest, choppiest black-and-white silent movies have become Pixar. Mixing chemicals in a lab has become splitting atoms in the Large Hadron Collider. The Wright Brothers&#x2019; 12 second, 120-foot flight has become routine trips 250 miles up to the International Space Station.</p> <p>But instead of me finishing that paragraph with, &#x201C;The primitive gas-burning car has become [something rad we can&#x2019;t even imagine],&#x201D; I have to finish it with, &#x201C;The primitive gas-burning car has become the better gas-burning car.&#x201D;</p> <p>As I said, if you were alive in 1900, you&#x2019;d have probably thought the idea of an AC induction electric car motor was awesome and futuristic, and the internal combustion engine, which was only an incremental advance from the early locomotive steam engines invented a century earlier, was kind of cool but not especially futuristic. But we&#x2019;re not alive in 1900, we&#x2019;re alive in 2015, so when <em>we </em>look at the modern gas engine that&#x2019;s in all of our cars, and we see <em>pistons </em>moving back and forth because of something hot exploding inside their cylinders&#x2014;<a href="#footnote2-28-3667" id="note2-28-3667" rel="footnote2">28</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif"><img class="  wp-image-3716 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/img11.gif" alt="img11" width="490" height="347"></a></p> <p>&#x2014;they should seem <em>outrageously ancient</em>.

The blue stuff is air that&#x2019;s being sucked in along with a small amount of gasoline that&#x2019;s fired in at just the right time by the fuel injector.</p> <p><strong>2) The Compression Stroke: </strong>This is the stroke where the piston moves up and as it does, the blue stuff turns orange. What&#x2019;s happening is that the valve that let the air in on the intake stroke has now closed and as the piston moves up, there&#x2019;s nowhere for the air/gas mixture to go, so it just compresses really tightly.</p> <p><strong>3) The Power Stroke: </strong>This is the stroke I feel like passionate car men talk about with a little twinkle in their eye. In the animation, this is where the piston moves down and there&#x2019;s orange above it which then turns gray by the end. The previous compression stroke has squeezed the air and gas tightly, and at the top of that stroke, the spark plug at the top of the cylinder emits a spark which ignites the compressed air and gas on fire and creates a little explosion. This explosion blows the piston back downwards. This stroke is where the power of the car engine comes from.</p> <p><strong>4) The Exhaust Stroke: </strong>This is the part where the piston pushes the gray stuff up and out of the cylinder. The gray stuff is exhaust&#x2014;i.e. smoke because you just lit a campfire in that cylinder&#x2014;that then makes its way out of the car&#x2019;s tailpipe. This smoke consists of mostly non-toxic gases with a little carbon monoxide and other poison mixed in for fun. Also in the exhaust is the carbon dioxide that just got created during the explosion, which allows the long-buried carbon in the gasoline to happily re-enter the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere after the most boring 300 million years ever underground.</p> <p>The furious back-and-forth motion of the pistons work together to forcefully turn what&#x2019;s called a crankshaft&#x2014;that metal bar contraption they&#x2019;re all connected to below&#x2014;which creates the turning motion that eventually turns the car&#x2019;s wheel axles. I think.<a href="#footnote-11-3667" id="note-11-3667" rel="footnote">11</a> </p><p>(For more info: first two minutes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zA_19bHxEYg" target="_blank">this video</a> shows this all in action, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W_NRHxekaY" target="_blank">this</a> is aesthetically pleasing.)</p> </div> <p>Now. I&#x2019;ll admit that car engines are cool. And I can see why some people are kind of obsessed with them.

We get used to the world we live in, whatever that world is like, but if you examine history and take a big step back, some things suddenly make no sense. And this is one of them.</p> <p>So the question we need to ask is why.</p> <p>If electric motors were the more advanced technology&#x2014;if they were considered <em>ideal</em> because they were quiet, clean, and took advantage of cutting edge technology&#x2014;why did the world give up on them? In 1900, neither electric nor gas cars were viable for mass adoption&#x2014;both needed a few key technological breakthroughs. The key breakthroughs needed for gas cars happened <em>first</em>&#x2014;but why was that reason for us to just settle, <em>permanently</em>, for the more primitive technology and the one that, over time, would make our cities smoggy and change the chemical makeup of our atmosphere? If 20th-century human invention could go from the Wright Brothers&#x2019; 12-second flight to the moon in just 66 years, surely advancing battery technology enough to bring electric car prices and charging times down while increasing range shouldn&#x2019;t have been beyond our scope. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Why did innovation and progress in something as important to the world as car-powering technology just <em>stop</em>?</span></p> <p>This question could be asked about other parts of the bigger story of the Fossil Fuels Era. You could just as easily puzzle over the question, &#x201C;America&#x2019;s first electricity power station, Edison&#x2019;s Pearl Street Station in Manhattan, first lit up in 1882, powered by burning coal&#x2014;how is it possible that in 2015, burning coal is still by far the primary way humanity produces electricity even though we&#x2019;ve known for decades that it&#x2019;s not an optimal or sustainable long-term method?&#x201D;</p> <p>The problem with the question &#x201C;Why did X technology stop moving forward?&#x201D; is that it&#x2019;s misunderstanding how progress works. Instead of asking why technological progress sometimes <em>stops</em>, we have to ask the question:</p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><em>Why does technological progress ever happen at all? </em></span></p> <p>The mistake of the first question is the intuitive but incorrect notion that technology naturally moves forward on its own over time&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t. I can tell you this for sure, because my Time Warner DVR has the exact same horrible user interface it had in 2004. The way technology works is that by default, it stands still, and it moves forward only when something <em>pushes </em>it forward.</p> <p>We often have the same intuitive misconception when we think about evolution. Natural selection doesn&#x2019;t make things &#x201C;better&#x201D;&#x2014;it just optimizes biology to best survive in whatever environmental circumstances it finds itself. When something in that environment changes&#x2014;a predator mutates and becomes faster, a certain type of food becomes scarce, an ice age rolls in&#x2014;it means species that were previously optimized to the environment no longer are. The environmental change alters the natural selection criteria, which applies a <em>pressure </em>on the species as it is, and over time, the genetics of the species will react to the pressure by changing in order to optimize to the new environment.</p> <p>When it comes to technology, a totally free and open market is the natural environment. But unlike the world of species, which is the eternal Wild West, human societies have another factor in play&#x2014;a god-type force called government. So if we&#x2019;re trying to figure out what makes technology move and change, we have to look at <em>two</em> sources of pressure: natural market conditions that ebb and flow and apply continual new pressures on all the actors within, and the &#x201C;god&#x201D; on top who can artificially change the environment below to create manufactured pressures. Let&#x2019;s examine both, starting with government:</p> <p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>1) Pressure From Government-Induced Environment Changes</strong></span></p> <p>The nature and power of a market&#x2019;s government-god varies significantly throughout the world. In North Korea, it is a Biblical-style, all-knowing, all-seeing, all-powerful ruler of the universe to the point where there <em>is</em> no natural market environment&#x2014;just the one god created and maintains. In Scandinavia, god is a wealthy power mom and the market is nestled in her warm bosom of safety and opportunity. In Central Africa, god made a lifestyle change and got a new job, working for the wealthiest families&#x2014;huge step up the ladder for him.</p> <p>In the US, god has an identity crisis, alternating between feelings of pride and self-loathing. It wants to have the best country, but it&#x2019;s standing on the street corner alone yelling out in an argument with itself about the right way to do that. When the US government (or a government like it) wants to play god and alter the American natural market environment to apply certain pressures in certain places, it uses three main tools: funding, regulation, and taxes.</p> <p><strong>Funding: </strong>In order for government funding to lead to major progress, there has to be a lot of it, and in an open democracy, that only flies when the nation needs to do something so important that everyone agrees on it&#x2014;like in the 1960s, when the fear of losing global influence kicked the US government&#x2019;s adrenaline in and it put a man on the moon. Likewise, significant US military funding is something the American electorate can agree on enough that it receives tremendous funding and plays an important part in advancing technology in a number of industries. In most cases, though, a divided democracy is too paralyzed by conflicting interests and political squabbling to be the main driver of a serious tech revolution.</p> <p><strong>Regulation: </strong>Another democratic government muscle is its ability to make rules&#x2014;laws, restrictions, quotas, etc. These can be effective at pushing through minor changes&#x2014;the seatbelt and airbag are both products of government regulation. But at least when it comes to the car industry, I&#x2019;m having a hard time thinking of instances of major technological <em>leaps</em> caused by government regulation.</p> <p><strong>Tax Code: </strong>The government often uses the tax code to add its own economic pressures into the free market. Again though, while this can be effective for <em>nudging </em>something in a certain direction, it doesn&#x2019;t tend to lead to sweeping advances.</p> <p>Of course, America is in a big fight about this, with fiscal liberals typically feeling a lot more optimistic about government&#x2019;s ability to play a positive role in moving things forward than fiscal conservatives. But I think both would agree that major tech progress being <em>forced </em>forward<em> </em>by the government is more the way of places like the Soviet Union and modern-day China where government has a lot more power. The incredible innovation that often emerges from open democracies tends to come from pressures from below, in the bubbling cauldron of the free market&#x2014;</p> <p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>2) Pressures From Natural Market Forces</strong> </span></p> <p>In the natural world, to catch food and stay away from predators, animals will optimize by becoming fast and elusive runners. When food on the ground becomes scarce, species will feel the pressure of hunger and over time, their genetics will re-optimize by developing good bodies for climbing or long necks or wings. A running species that becomes a flying species hasn&#x2019;t become <em>better&#x2014;</em>just better fit for the current circumstances. In the world of species, the definition of optimization is simple because the end goals are simple: the core needs of biological creatures are always the same&#x2014;to self-preserve and reproduce. So optimization in the natural world always has the same definition: to adjust in a way that makes you mostly likely to self-preserve and reproduce.</p> <p>In order to understand what optimization means in the market, we need to know what the core goals are of the actors there. Of course, people are also biological creatures, and self-preservation will always be at the top of the list&#x2014;if you&#x2019;re hungry, cold, or sick, fixing that will be the core goal. But for people whose base needs are being met, what are the yearning desires that then lie at the core of their motivation? What does &#x201C;pursuing your self-interest&#x201D; mean for them?</p> <p>Well, it depends on the culture. In certain cultures, the fear of failure is so strong that it outweighs desires like glory or great fortune, and the primary inner drive becomes to just make sure you&#x2019;re passable. In others, the deepest drive of the people might be religious salvation, community or family service, a leisurely lifestyle, or spiritual enlightenment.</p> <p>When it comes to technological advancement, those motivations aren&#x2019;t likely to get you there because thinking up tech innovations isn&#x2019;t a helpful step on the path to optimization for those people. So if we want tech progress, what kind of yearning do we want people to feel?</p> <p>I think the ideal mix is a two-part cocktail:</p> <p><strong>First ingredient: Greed. </strong>In a perfect, fair, open market, greed works great as the core lifeblood motivation. The way capitalism theoretically works is that the more real-world value you create, the more money you&#x2019;ll make. So companies in a competitive landscape will put their effort into creating better and better products and services in order to optimize, which for them means making as much money as they possibly can. Individual people are greedy as a means to all kinds of ends&#x2014;a lavish lifestyle, personal freedom, security, admiration, power, sex&#x2014;but <em>what</em> they want is irrelevant. As long as their burning desire makes them <em>really want stuff</em>, their drive to optimize will move technology forward. Greed is a double-edged sword though&#x2014;to be beneficial, greed has to be contained inside a high-integrity, meritocratic, free market. If it&#x2019;s not, greed will turn into the enemy of progress, because the more vulnerable the system is to corruption, the more the greedy on top will be able to game the system to ensure their own long-lasting victory.</p> <p><strong>Second ingredient: Raging ambition.</strong> Greed can lead to steady forward progress, but in order for progress to <em>leap </em>forward, a second ingredient is usually key: a burning desire to do something great. Again, the underlying reasons for this kind of ambition can vary. Sometimes it&#x2019;ll be an ego-driven desire&#x2014;to be famous and renowned, to leave one&#x2019;s mark, to be thought of and posthumously remembered as <em>great</em>. Other times the ambition will be fueled by a borderline-insane level of confidence and optimism that gives someone the gall to be idealistic. These are the yearnings of the <em>hungry underdog. </em></p> <p>An established industry full of existing winners running on greed is like the highest layer of trees in a crowded rainforest. They&#x2019;ll push upward only as needed, elbowing each other for little gains and victories as they vie for sunlight, mostly just trying to keep their spot in the canopy. Greed just wants sunlight&#x2014;it doesn&#x2019;t care how high up it is when it gets it.</p> <p>But below, the hungry underdog <em>burns</em> for sunlight and will spend 100 hours a week trying to figure out how to get it. When the breakthrough comes, the underdog <em>bursts </em>up through the canopy into the open sky and spreads its leaves out wide. Suddenly, the trees that had been on top are blocked from the sun. Greed is then replaced by the much more powerful drive of <i>survival</i>, and innovation kicks into high gear as they scramble upwards for their life. The environment has changed&#x2014;it&#x2019;s been <i>disrupted</i>&#x2014;and in this new world, created by the underdog disruptor, companies have to innovate in order to re-optimize. Some end up back on top, others die&#x2014;and at the end of it all, technology has jolted forward. We all witnessed an example of this when Apple rocketed through the mobile phone canopy in 2007 and forced all of the other companies to make a smartphone or die. Samsung managed to get itself back into the sun. Nokia did not.</p> <p>With all this in mind, let&#x2019;s go back to the car industry and our original question:</p> <p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>Why hasn&#x2019;t the car technology forest moved upward over the past century?</strong> </span></p> <p>I see two primary reasons:</p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>1) Insanely high barriers to entry&#x2014;so no leaps forward caused by hungry underdogs</strong></span></p> <p>Try to think of something ickier and harder than starting a car company.</p> <p>First, before you can sell one product, you&#x2019;ll need to put down an absurd amount of capital to buy a factory, figure out how to design a car and all of its parts, build a prototype, use that to raise a lot more money, get a much bigger factory and hire thousands of people, and pump many millions of dollars into marketing to tell the world that your company exists. And you probably need to be incredibly rich and risk-tolerant yourself since very few people are zany enough to invest money in a startup car company.</p> <p>Second, in order to be profitable, you have to sell at a high volume. Cars are too expensive to make and margins are too thin to only sell a few each year. So for this to be a good idea, you not only have to create an awesome car, but one that a ton of people will want to buy.</p> <p>Third, gas cars are already well-optimized&#x2014;if you want to aggressively burst through the canopy like an underdog without any brand awareness needs to, you have to create a <em>much better type of car than what&#x2019;s out there</em>. In the case of cars, that probably means addressing the core of the car itself and the thing that&#x2019;s been stressing everyone out with its billowing emissions&#x2014;the engine. But since no one has really done this yet, it means you need to not only create the first successful startup car company in a long time, you need to create the first startup to <em>ever </em>succeed at making whatever type of car you&#x2019;re creating. And since you&#x2019;ll be there first to do it, you&#x2019;ll have to put a huge amount of time and money into innovation research and development and bear the brunt of the invention costs for the whole industry. You&#x2019;ll also have to bear the marketing costs to educate the world on why they should want this new type of car&#x2014;that&#x2019;s a one-time expense and once it&#x2019;s done, other companies will be able to ride on the consumer demand you spent a ton of money building.</p> <p>So it&#x2019;s not surprising that the last successful startup car company in America was Chrysler in 1925&#x2014;90 years ago. It&#x2019;s basically an impossible endeavor.</p> <p>And without any threat from below on the forest floor&#x2014;from the wild innovation of scrappy entrepreneurs with nothing to lose&#x2014;the car industry has had the luxury of calmly sunbathing in a tight canopy quilt, making only incremental advances, only when they&#x2019;re needed. But there&#x2019;s a problem here too&#x2014;</p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>2) A glitch in the car market separates car company optimization from what&#x2019;s best for the world.</strong></span></p> <p>As I mentioned above, greed works nicely as an optimization criterion <em>if </em>the market is perfect&#x2014;open, accurate, and fair.</p> <p>Greedy companies will make their decisions based on whatever the best way is to optimize to their environment&#x2014;i.e. How can we make the most possible money? But a company&#x2019;s drive for maximum money is only beneficial to society when the company&#x2019;s profit is tightly and accurately correlated with the amount of net positive value its product or service provides to society.</p> <p>If I start a lemonade stand, every time I give someone a delicious cup of lemonade, they&#x2019;ll be likely to recommend me to their friends and become a recurring customer. I provided positive value and my business&#x2019;s success went up with it.</p> <p><strong>Success = <span style="color: #339966;">Value Provided<span style="color: #000000;">.</span></span> </strong>Incentives are aligned.</p> <p>If another customer comes to the stand and I give him a cup of lemonade with a fly in it, he won&#x2019;t come back and he&#x2019;ll tell his friends not to go&#x2014;I caused harm and my success went down.</p> <p><strong>Success = <span style="color: #339966;">[Value Provided]</span> &#x2013; <span style="color: #ff0000;">[Harm Caused]</span>. </strong>Incentives still aligned.</p> <p>But what if I then discover a chemical I can spray on my lemonade that prevents flies from landing on it. The chemical is tasteless, but I know that drinking it regularly will cause customers immense harm a few decades down the road. Customers won&#x2019;t experience the harm in the present, so it won&#x2019;t affect their opinion of my lemonade or the success of my business.</p> <p><strong>Success = <span style="color: #339966;">[Value Provided]</span> &#x2013; <del><span style="color: #808080;">[Harm Caused]</span></del></strong><b>. </b></p> <p>The harm caused is now an <em>unaccounted-for cost</em>, also known as a negative externality, and my incentives are no longer aligned with the customer&#x2019;s best interests. If all I care about is greed and maximizing profit, I will continue to use the chemical, because I&#x2019;m economically incentivized to do so.</p> <p>This kind of negative externality is how tobacco companies got away with murder for so many decades. The long-term cost to customers&#x2019; health was unaccounted for because customers were ignorant to the consequences, the negative effects were years away, and there was no regulatory penalty in place to charge for the harm. Thinking purely from a greed-optimizing perspective, cigarette companies acted completely rationally. They kicked up nicotine levels in cigarettes and added shards of glass into filters to create tiny cuts and increase nicotine absorption, which caused further harm but increased demand&#x2014;but since the harm was unaccounted for, this was a pure net positive for the company. And when anti-tobacco campaigns started to educate customers on cigarette harm&#x2014;which attaches the harm to the cost of scared customers and lower demand&#x2014;the tobacco industry hired low-integrity scientists to discredit the negative campaigns and muddle the message. Awareness would get there eventually, but the longer they could delay and keep the harm hidden, the better off they&#x2019;d be from a greed standpoint.</p> <p>People call this evil, but all it really is is an industry acting in its own best interests within the parameters of its environment. Greed is a simple motivation&#x2014;it takes whatever it can get, and it&#x2019;ll push all available limits it can in order to fully optimize. I used tobacco companies as an example, but you could easily tell the story with fast food, radiation-emitting consumer electronics, politician behavior, the finance industry, and many others.</p> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">In the auto industry, CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are the negative externality.</span> If you have a cheap and easy way to build cars that dump garbage into the atmosphere and no one makes you pay for it, why would you ever change anything?</p> <p>It&#x2019;s the same story as cigarettes. Instead of the tobacco industry and the cigarette companies who support it, you have the oil industry and the car companies who support it. Instead of short-term emphysema, you have short term city smog. Instead of long-term harm to people&#x2019;s health like lung cancer, you have long-term harm to the human way of life like underwater coastal cities.</p> <p>A lot of people have written about the hidden cost of carbon emissions, and many of them, on <a href="http://niskanencenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/The-Conservative-Case-for-a-Carbon-Tax1.pdf" target="_blank">both</a> <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/23/opinion/paul-krugman-conservatives-and-climate-change.html" target="_blank">sides</a> of the political spectrum, have proposed a logical solution: <strong>a revenue-neutral carbon tax.</strong></p> <p>A revenue-neutral carbon tax is revenue-neutral because any increase in government revenue as a result of the tax would be offset by an equal decrease in something else like income taxes. This makes it a politically moot proposal.</p> <p>The tax could be applied at any point along the supply chain from oil extraction to the gas pump and the effect would be the same&#x2014;it would either become more expensive to drive a gas car, less profitable to be in the business of gas, or both. With a carbon tax in place, when you&#x2019;re contributing to the carbon problem, you&#x2019;re also paying for it&#x2014;which incentivizes consumers and companies to explore alternatives. This wouldn&#x2019;t be the government meddling in the market&#x2014;it would be the government fixing a glitch in the market.</p> <p class="p1">Instead, the government offers tax breaks to people for buying an electric vehicle and subsidies for the renewable energy industry, which is like a town full of businesses who throw their trash in the street, and the government reacting by paying businesses to stop doing that, instead of just charging businesses for doing it. Other times, the government tries to force emissions downwards by forcing car companies to create a minimum number of zero-emissions cars&#x2014;with limited effect. Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton both tried this, to some extent, and both times the next president (Reagan and Bush) removed the regulations upon taking office (ironically, the Clinton mandate for more hybrid cars accomplished nothing in the US, but it scared the shit out of Toyota, who began furiously innovating and created the Prius). Another time, in 1990, the California government tried to institute its own zero-emissions regulations, which the car and oil companies fought until they finally bullied California out of it and the regulations were removed in 2003.<a href="#footnote-12-3667" id="note-12-3667" rel="footnote">12</a> The problem is, giant companies have enough influence that any government attempt at making changes through regulation ends up being watered down to the point where it&#x2019;s ineffective.</p> <p class="p1">When it comes to a carbon tax, the only explanation for not having one seems to be the power big oil has over the US government&#x2014;because to me, it seems like every politician in either party should be in favor of a revenue-neutral carbon tax. Right?</p> <p>Without any negative consequence of emitting carbon, optimizing for greed pushes certain car technologies forward, like safety, comfort, and drive quality, because getting high safety and quality ratings is tied to demand&#x2014;but it <em>doesn&#x2019;t</em> change anything about carbon emissions, because the greed equation doesn&#x2019;t currently include that cost.</p> <p>So the reason why, 112 years after Ford Motor Company&#x2019;s founding, we&#x2019;re still using harmful, old-fashioned engines is simple: none of the pressures on the car industry are pushing it to change. The car industry still needs to work hard to optimize in <em>certain</em> areas&#x2014;that&#x2019;s why cars have become safer, smoother, more comfortable, and more efficient over the years. But the most glaring flaw of the modern car&#x2014;that it constantly dumps garbage into the atmosphere&#x2014;remains untouched, because doing so is free, because big oil&#x2019;s influence means government keeps allowing it, and because there&#x2019;s no one from underneath to burst through the canopy and show customers that there&#x2019;s a better way.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s scary. Something really, terribly bad might be happening that could make our actual lives legitimately worse in the future, but we have a prisoner&#x2019;s dilemma on our hands&#x2014;it&#x2019;s much, much better for all of us collectively to make a change, but for <em>each individual </em>CEO, lobbyist, or politician, there&#x2019;s more to <em>personally </em>gain from maintaining the status quo. People like to say, &#x201C;this is the world our children will live in and we&#x2019;re botching it for them,&#x201D; but for the people with the power to change something, their <em>particular</em> children will be best off if they make the most money possible. The situation is stuck.</p> <p>A deeply-set, stagnant industry is like a country led by a deeply-entrenched dynasty&#x2014;it&#x2019;s hard to penetrate the status quo. But even in the case of the most powerful caste systems, sometimes the right person comes along at the right time and starts the right movement, and a revolution can ignite.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 24pt;"><strong><a name="part3"></a>Part 3: The Story of Tesla</strong></span></p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Tesla.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3781" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Story-of-Tesla.png" alt="Story of Tesla" width="182" height="182"></a></p> <p>Christie Nicholson remembers meeting Elon Musk for the first time at a party back in 1989.</p> <p>&#x201C;I believe the second sentence out of his mouth was &#x2018;I think a lot about electric cars,&#x2019;&#x201D; Christie said. &#x201C;And then he turned to me and said, &#x2018;Do you think about electric cars?&#x2019;&#x201D;<a href="#footnote-13-3667" id="note-13-3667" rel="footnote">13</a> </p><p>Electric cars seems like an odd thing to spend your time thinking about in 1989. To understand why Musk felt so strongly about them, let&#x2019;s start by understanding what electric cars are and how they work.</p> <p>There are a handful of common modern types of cars considered greener than traditional gas cars&#x2014;namely hybrid cars, plug-in hybrid cars, and electric cars (which we&#x2019;ll call EVs for &#x201C;electric vehicles&#x201D;). There&#x2019;s also a lot of talk about another type&#x2014;hydrogen fuel cell cars, which we&#x2019;ll just call hydrogen cars. The one thing these cars all have in common is an electric motor.</p> <p>There are two types of electric motors&#x2014;the AC induction motor and the brushless DC electric motor. Since 98% of people reading this aren&#x2019;t licking their lips to read a three-paragraph description of the difference, let it suffice to say that they&#x2019;re the same basic idea:</p> <p>An electric motor is a <a href="http://farm1.static.flickr.com/173/432632095_8b49ad80ba.jpg" target="_blank">pig in a blanket</a> where electricity is sent into the outer bread part (called the stator), which is always stationary, and that electric current causes the hot dog part (called the rotor) to rotate. The rotor is attached to the wheel axle which turns the wheels. Like this:<a href="#footnote2-29-3667" id="note2-29-3667" rel="footnote2">29</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/indhvtuiction.gif"><img class=" size-full wp-image-3696 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/indhvtuiction.gif" alt="indhvtuiction" width="320" height="240"></a></p> <div class="wbwAside"> <p><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><b>How an AC Induction Motor Works Blue Box</b></span></p> <p>One of the two common types of electric motor is the AC induction motor (that&#x2019;s what Tesla cars use). AC stands for alternating current,<a href="#footnote-14-3667" id="note-14-3667" rel="footnote">14</a> and induction means there&#x2019;s no physical contact between the rotor and the stator&#x2014;electricity in the stator generates a rotating magnetic field which enters the rotor through electrical induction and causes it to spin.</p> <p>The stator generates a rotating magnetic field by sending electricity through it in a three phase system:<a href="#footnote2-30-3667" id="note2-30-3667" rel="footnote2">30</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/inductionmotoranimation.gif"><img class="  wp-image-3698 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/inductionmotoranimation.gif" alt="inductionmotoranimation" width="513" height="342"></a></p> <p>So there are three different wires each with an alternating back-and-forth pull&#x2014;just look at any one color and you&#x2019;ll see it&#x2019;s just going back and forth. But the three wires&#x2019; currents are staggered in just the right way that the point of &#x201C;pull&#x201D; in the stator rotates in a smooth circle. When the rotor is added in, this rotating magnetic field causes it to spin:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/generatoranimation.gif"><img class="  wp-image-3697 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/generatoranimation.gif" alt="generatoranimation" width="485" height="323"></a></p> <p>The idea is that the rotor can never quite catch up to where it wants to be&#x2014;it&#x2019;s always &#x201C;chasing&#x201D; the rotor&#x2019;s field, and that chase is what powers the car. The AC induction motor was invented by Nikola Tesla, and that&#x2019;s why Tesla Motors is named after him.<a href="#footnote-15-3667" id="note-15-3667" rel="footnote">15</a> </p></div> <p>Here are the types of cars that use an electric motor:</p> <p><strong>Hybrids </strong>(also called HEVs for hybrid electric vehicles), like the Toyota Prius, have both an electric motor <em>and </em>an internal combustion engine. You don&#x2019;t plug a hybrid car in&#x2014;the gas charges the battery. The battery also gets charge from an electric motor trick called regenerative braking. Normally, all the joules of kinetic energy a car is harnessing when it&#x2019;s moving are lost when the car brakes and they&#x2019;re just converted into heat. With regenerative braking, electric cars send some of that kinetic energy back into the battery, holding onto those joules to be used again later. The electric component of a hybrid replaces some of the need to burn gas, increasing the miles per gallon, decreasing the car&#x2019;s emissions, and saving the driver gas money. Hybrids are a big step up in technology from normal gas cars.</p> <p>But they still kind of suck. Why? Because they&#x2019;re only kind of helping the emissions problem, not solving it, and they still need to burn gas to work. As I&#x2019;ve heard people say, a world 100% full of Prius drivers is still a world 100% addicted to oil.</p> <p><strong>Plug-in hybrids </strong>(also called PHEVs) are a better option. Plug-in hybrid cars, like the Chevy Volt, the Honda Accord Plug-In Hybrid, and the Ford Fusion Energi, allow you to charge the battery at home and typically drive 10-40 miles just on battery power before the gas kicks in. That&#x2019;s often enough to get most people through most of their day, meaning they may rarely need to use gas.</p> <p>But if we&#x2019;re gonna get <em>so close</em>, why not just go all the way?</p> <p><strong>Hydrogen cars </strong>are entirely electric&#x2014;but they don&#x2019;t use a battery. Instead, they fill up with fuel at a station just like a gas car&#x2014;except they fill up with compressed hydrogen, not gas. The hydrogen mixes with oxygen in the air to produce electricity, which it sends to the motor to power the car. They produce no tailpipe emissions because the only byproduct is clean water. Sounds great, right?</p> <p>Musk, for the life of him, cannot understand how anyone could make an argument in favor of hydrogen cars,<a href="#footnote-16-3667" id="note-16-3667" rel="footnote">16</a> but it&#x2019;s confusing because lots of car companies, like Toyota, Honda, and General Motors, are currently pouring big investments into making hydrogen cars. I wanted to understand the disagreement, so I read like 12 articles in favor and opposed to the technology. At the end of it, I&#x2019;m having a hard time seeing why hydrogen cars would have a more promising future than electric vehicles. For those who want details, here&#x2019;s a footnote.<a href="#footnote-17-3667" id="note-17-3667" rel="footnote">17</a> </p><p>Finally, there are <strong>electric cars, or</strong> <strong>EVs</strong>, like the Nissan Leaf, the BMW i3, the Ford Focus Electric, and the Tesla Model S.<strong> </strong>These are simple&#x2014;there&#x2019;s a big battery, which you charge, and it powers the electric motor. No liquid involved.</p> <p>Now, in <em>theory</em>, EVs make a lot of sense. Forgetting the rest of the car for a second, let&#x2019;s look at some of the advantages of the electric motor over the internal combustion gas engine:</p> <p><strong>Electric motors are more convenient than gas engines most of the time. </strong>Gas cars have to go to the gas station; EV owners plug their car in every night the same way they charge their phone&#x2014;no stopping for gas. A gas engine is a lot more complicated than an electric motor, with over 200 parts; an electric motor has fewer than 10. A gas engine requires a transmission, a tailpipe, gears, and a bunch of other grease-covered shit; an EV has none of those things&#x2014;when you open the hood, it&#x2019;s more storage space, like the trunk. Gas engines need oil, which means they need oil changes; EVs don&#x2019;t. The extra complexity means gas cars end up needing a lot more maintenance than EVs.</p> <p><strong>It costs a lot less to power an electric motor than a gas engine. </strong>The extra costs gas car owners incur for oil changes and car repairs aside, the gas engine&#x2019;s fuel&#x2014;gas&#x2014;is much more expensive than the electric motor&#x2019;s fuel&#x2014;electricity. Let&#x2019;s look at the math:</p> <p>The average electric car gets about 3 miles per kWh<a href="#footnote-18-3667" id="note-18-3667" rel="footnote">18</a> of electricity, and the US national average electricity rate is 12 cents per kWh. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">That means that driving a mile in an electric car costs about 4 cents. </span></p> <p>The cost of driving a gas car is harder, because gas prices and car fuel efficiency widely vary. The best case scenario for a gas car is unusually cheap gas (let&#x2019;s say $1.40/gallon) coupled with unusually high fuel efficiency (let&#x2019;s say it&#x2019;s a rare gas car that gets 35 mpg). That would produce the same 4 cents/mile that electric cars get. But very few gas car owners ever pay 4 cents/mile. Without being crazy extreme, for the worse case scenario, let&#x2019;s say a high $4.00/gallon gas and a below-average 15 mpg&#x2014;in that case, a mile in a gas car costs 27 cents per mile. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">At a pretty typical 12,000 miles/year, that means at absolute best, gas is tied with electric for cost, and at worst, it costs over $3,000/year more to drive on gas.</span></p> <p><strong>The gas engine is one of the two major causes of the energy/climate crisis. </strong>We&#x2019;ve already discussed this&#x2014;transportation burning oil makes up a third of the world emissions, pollutes cities, and makes nations over-dependent on other nations. The electric motor emits nothing. Yes, it may run on electricity that was produced in a dirty way&#x2014;but we&#x2019;ll get to that later.</p> <p>So that&#x2019;s why Musk told Christie Nicholson that he thinks a lot about electric cars. The electric motor is clearly the easier, cheaper, and more sensible long-term plan for powering cars.</p> <p>But when the electric motor made its first appearance over 100 years ago, there were serious drawbacks that prevented it from becoming the norm&#x2014;and since electric cars went out of production back then, little time or money has been spent trying to fix those issues. There tend to be three age-old concerns about the viability of the electric car:</p> <p><strong>EV Concern 1) Range. </strong>This is really three issues rolled into one:</p> <p>A) Will the battery life be too short for long drives, limiting an EV to a car only for local driving?</p> <p>B) If I&#x2019;m out and about and need to recharge my battery on the road, is there anywhere to do it? Or will I end up stranded?</p> <p>C) If I do find a charging station while on the road, will I have to sit there for five hours while it charges?</p> <p>These issues are such a prevalent concern among potential EV-owners that they have their own term: range anxiety.</p> <p><b>EV Concern 2) Performance. </b>The most common electric vehicle you&#x2019;ll see around today is the golf cart. Which doesn&#x2019;t excite car owners very much. No one wants a car that drives like shit, and when people think about zooming acceleration, they tend to think about powerful gas engines, not electric motors.</p> <p><strong>EV Concern 3) Price. </strong>Ever since the beginning, EVs have cost more than gas cars, mainly because of the high cost of the battery.</p> <p>Back in 1910, people cited these exact same three concerns over electric cars, and they&#x2019;re part of the reason gas cars won the day. Gas cars had had their own major problems, but Ford had figured out how to make them viable&#x2014;something no one has yet done for the electric car.</p> <p>I asked Musk about his opinion on Henry Ford. He said, &#x201C;Ford was the kind of guy that when something was in the way, he found a way around it, he just got it done. He was really focused on what the customer needed, even when the customer didn&#x2019;t know what they needed.&#x201D;</p> <p>When he decided in 2003 to stop thinking about electric cars and start making them, the odds weren&#x2019;t in Musk&#x2019;s favor. There were the high barriers to entry that had prevented any startup car company from succeeding in almost a century; there was the unaccounted for cost of carbon emissions, which made starting an EV company like trying to stand out on a basketball court as a rookie when all the players except you can foul with no penalty; there was the gargantuan oil industry, which would do everything in its power to stomp on any effort to make it obsolete; and on top of that, the EV was a new kind of car whose development had essentially been on pause ever since EV makers threw in the towel a century earlier, and a daunting and costly catch-up process would lay ahead&#x2014;the three concerns listed above would all need to somehow be addressed for this to have a chance.</p> <p>The overarching question was, had electric cars never had their day because of irreconcilable issues? Or had the right person&#x2014;the Henry Ford of EVs&#x2014;just not come along yet?</p> <p style="text-align: center;">___________</p> <p>Car companies aren&#x2019;t supposed to start in Silicon Valley, and Silicon Valley startups aren&#x2019;t supposed to make cars.</p> <p>But the electric car industry is not your grandfather&#x2019;s car industry. And in 2003, it wasn&#x2019;t anyone&#x2019;s car industry. After the brief bubble of new electric cars in California in the 1990s between the year the state passed the Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate and the year they were bullied into repealing it, the electric car industry had withered into the oblivion of the scattered California garages and tech labs of car geeks. But big things have emerged out of small groups of cutting-edge California geek labs. Apple. Microsoft. Google. So why not the modern electric car industry?</p> <p>One of these little car technology companies was AC Propulsion, and while carmakers in Detroit, Tokyo, and Munich continued to not realize that electric cars were clearly the future, the guys at AC Propulsion were experimenting away, quietly making one giant EV breakthrough after another.</p> <p>One day last week, I cold called AC Propulsion and accosted their CTO, Paul Carosa, who had been there since the beginning. He was too polite to figure out how to get off the phone with me, so he told me about those years in the late 90s and early 2000s when they created their fanciest car to date&#x2014;the tzero (pronounced t-zero). AC Propulsion had figured out two huge things:</p> <p>First, the tzero was <em>fast&#x2014;</em>it went 0 to 60 in 4.9 seconds, which was crazy fast for an electric car and put it on par with the fast gas cars.</p> <p>Second, they had made big progress on an enormous EV shortcoming by getting innovative with the battery. Previous EVs had used lead-acid batteries, which were heavy and limited. AC Propulsion realized that the laptop and mobile phone industry had been pouring development into making small 18650 lithium-ion batteries increasingly efficient, and that those batteries had gotten <em>really</em><em> </em>advanced. 18650 batteries look like AA batteries, which seems like an odd match for a car, but by lining up a few <em>thousand </em>of them in a big battery case, they had just created by <em>far </em>the world&#x2019;s best ever car battery. EVs had always been limited to a 60 or 80 or <em>maybe</em> a 120-mile range. The tzero could go 250 miles on a single charge.</p> <p>In 2003, a California engineer named JB Straubel was then tinkering around with EVs himself, met Musk to ask for funding for a car project he was working on. Soon after that, Straubel brought Musk by the AC Propulsion office to see the tzero. Musk was blown away. Musk had suspected for a while that EVs were the way of the future, and now that he saw the possibilities with his own eyes, he was convinced.</p> <p>At the time, he was already running SpaceX and trying to colonize Mars, so launching a startup car company wasn&#x2019;t something he could really fit into his calendar. He really wanted the world to see the tzero because he was sure it would excite people and help to stoke a new wave of EV interest&#x2014;and he tried to convince the AC Propulsion guys to bring the tzero to market, with his funding, but they didn&#x2019;t want to deal with that because it sounded icky. Instead, AC Propulsion introduced Musk to a group of three other entrepreneurs who had also recently approached them with a similar idea and had also been rebuffed. Those three guys, who included Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, had come up with the idea of licensing AC Propulsion&#x2019;s technology and bringing it to market themselves as a new company called Tesla Motors<a href="#footnote-19-3667" id="note-19-3667" rel="footnote">19</a>&#x2014;but to make any of this real, they needed money. It was a perfect match, so they decided to make a run at it together. Musk, who could only dedicate part time to the project, could fund the effort, become Chairman and maintain a strong influence, but by making Eberhard CEO, he could focus on SpaceX with the bulk of his time. And Tesla was on its way.</p> <p>The group formed a team and started figuring out how to be a car company. One big problem they had was that this was a new technology, and the R&amp;D costs early on for a new technology drive up the price of the product&#x2014;that&#x2019;s the same reason the very first cell phones and computers started out really expensive. Except in those cases, they were the first of their kind, so the product could be super expensive and still sell. Because perfectly good, affordable gas cars already exist, it wouldn&#x2019;t work to come out with the equivalent quality of a $25,000 gas car for $100,000+. So this became the business plan:</p> <p><strong>Step 1: High-priced, low-volume car for the super rich.</strong> Come out with the expensive first product, but make the car so fancy that it&#x2019;s worth that price&#x2014;i.e. just make it a legit Ferrari competitor and then it&#x2019;s okay to charge over $100,000 for it.</p> <p><strong>Step 2: Mid-priced, mid-volume car for the pretty rich. </strong>Use the profits from Step 1 to develop the Step 2 car. It would still be expensive, but more like a $75,000 Mercedes or BMW competitor instead of Ferrari.</p> <p><strong>Step 3: Low-priced, high-volume car for the masses. </strong>Use the profits from Step 2 to develop a $35,000-ish car that, after the government&#x2019;s $7,500 EV tax credit and the savings on gas, would be affordable to the middle class.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s kind of a Hershey&#x2019;s Kiss business plan:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3791" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid.png" alt="pyramid" width="527" height="397"></a></p> <p>The overarching mission wasn&#x2019;t to build the biggest car company in the world. It was to solve a bunch of long-standing EV shortcomings and build such an insanely great car that it could change everyone&#x2019;s perception of what an EV could be and force the world&#x2019;s big car companies to have to develop their own line of great EVs. Their end goal, and the company&#x2019;s official mission, was &#x201C;to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.&#x201D; In other words, EVs are gonna happen, but we&#x2019;re gonna make them happen a lot <em>sooner</em>. Sooner, in this case, is important, because it means carbon emissions decrease earlier and the long term effects of them are much less damaging.</p> <p>So they got working. And four years later, they had their Step 1 car, the<strong> Roadster:</strong><a href="#footnote2-31-3667" id="note2-31-3667" rel="footnote2">31</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tesla1.jpg"><img class="  wp-image-3739 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Tesla1.jpg" alt="Tesla1" width="506" height="337"></a></p> <p>With the Roadster, Tesla wasn&#x2019;t trying to make their long term car (one Tesla employee told me that from the beginning, Musk would make sure everyone knew that the company&#x2019;s long-term mission &#x201C;was <em>not</em> to make toys for rich people.&#x201D;) They just wanted to build something awesome to A) show the world how great an EV could be, and B) generate revenue to develop their Step 2 car. So they didn&#x2019;t start from scratch on the body design, instead basing it on a Lotus Elise.</p> <p>The Roadster didn&#x2019;t change the world&#x2014;no $110,000 car ever could&#x2014;but it sent a message to the industry that Tesla was for real. You may not have heard of the Roadster when it was announced in 2006 or when it started shipping in 2008, but some of the major car companies took notice&#x2014;Nissan soon launched the all-electric Leaf and GM launched the plug-in electric Chevy Volt soon after the Roadster&#x2019;s appearance (Bob Lutz, who was Chairman of GM at the time, openly credits Tesla for their decision to make the Volt, saying that after the Roadster unveiling, he went to the GM board and asked, &#x201C;If a little company in California can do this, why can&#x2019;t we?&#x201D;).</p> <p>But there were some pretty big problems with the first product. Finishing the car was taking way longer than planned, the cost of making each Roadster was way higher than planned, and the early shipments often had defects. This made Musk sad, so he and the board fired Eberhard as CEO, which made Eberhard sad.<a href="#footnote-20-3667" id="note-20-3667" rel="footnote">20</a> Just as this was going down, the most inconvenient thing ever happened&#x2014;the 2008 recession&#x2014;which made the entire car industry sad, but especially Tesla, who didn&#x2019;t yet have brand recognition and wasn&#x2019;t yet profitable because of all the upfront investment they had been pouring in. A crippling recession is never helpful, but it was <em>really, really </em>bad timing for Tesla.</p> <p>Musk had hired a second CEO, but a year in, in late 2008, the company was in one of those movie scenes where the person&#x2019;s been badly wounded and clearly about to die and there&#x2019;s this dramatic dialogue scene and the dying person is saying some last words and every time they pause for a second the audience is like, &#x201C;Is that it? Are they dead? Oh no they just talked again I guess there&#x2019;s one more line.&#x201D; Musk, who wasn&#x2019;t enjoying the drama of the scene, finally was like, &#x201C;PAUSE THE MOVIE QUICKLY PAUSE IT PAUSE IT&#x201D; and took over as CEO,<a href="#footnote-21-3667" id="note-21-3667" rel="footnote">21</a>going into full adrenaline mode to try to keep the company alive. And as mentioned in the last post, SpaceX was in the same movie at the same time playing the same role, so Musk&#x2019;s life was like this:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/S-T1.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3772" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/S-T1.png" alt="S-T" width="550" height="342"></a></p> <p> </p> <p>But enough people had been impressed enough by Tesla that a couple key investments at critical moments came in and kept the company alive, and at the end of the whole mess, Tesla was now a new company. Musk was CEO, and the Jonathan Ive of the car industry, star car designer Franz von Holzhausen, who had been the Design Director at GM and then Mazda, had decided to bet his career on the barely-standing Tesla and became their chief designer.</p> <p>A few weeks ago, when I stepped into the Tesla design studio to meet von Holzhausen, I was excited to meet the uber-flamboyant diva celebrity car designer, just hoping I would understand what he was saying through his unbelievably thick German accent&#x2014;and was horribly disappointed to meet an extremely normal-acting American man.</p> <p>The studio, which I described in the <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/05/elon-musk-the-worlds-raddest-man.html" target="_blank">last post</a>, is a shiny playroom of art and physics. Von Holzhausen showed me a full-size clay car that was simultaneously testing two different possible designs for the upcoming Model 3 by making the two halves of the model different. He explained how precise everything about car design is and how &#x201C;a difference of a quarter millimeter can spread itself across the entire car.&#x201D;</p> <p>I asked him what it was like to come to Tesla after having spent years at more established car companies. He described the difference like this: &#x201C;A company like GM is a finance-driven company who always has to live up to financial expectations. Here we look at it the other way around&#x2014;the product is successful when it&#x2019;s great, and the company becomes great because of that.&#x201D; (This mirrored what Musk had told me earlier in the day: &#x201C;The moment the person leading a company thinks numbers have value in themselves, the company&#x2019;s done. The moment the CFO becomes CEO&#x2014;it&#x2019;s done. Game over.&#x201D;) Von Holzhausen went on, saying, &#x201C;Another difference is that at other companies, engineering comes first&#x2014;a design package is prescribed on the designer and they&#x2019;re told to make it beautiful. At Tesla, design and engineering are assigned equal value, and Elon keeps them opposed to each other.&#x201D; Now that von Holzhausen has gotten used to his freedom to be obsessed with the product at Tesla, he says he &#x201C;would dread to go back to pre-historic ways.&#x201D;</p> <p>Von Holzhausen&#x2019;s first mission at Tesla was to design their Step 2 car&#x2014;the mid-priced, mid-volume one&#x2014;that would be called the<strong> Model S</strong>. The Roadster was based on existing design and was a springboard for the company more than a long-term product. The Model S would be Tesla&#x2019;s first flagship product, and it was their chance to reinvent the concept of a car, from scratch. Von Holzhausen said, &#x201C;When we started Model S, it was a clean sheet of paper.&#x201D;</p> <p>This all sounded uncannily similar to how Steve Jobs had done things at Apple. He obsessed over making &#x201C;insanely great products,&#x201D; and he never paid attention to what other companies were doing, always coming at things from a clean sheet of paper perspective. When Apple decided to make a phone, they didn&#x2019;t try to make a better Blackberry&#x2014;they asked, &#x201C;What should a mobile phone be?&#x201D;</p> <p>Over time, big industries tend to get flabby and uncreative and risk-averse&#x2014;and if the right outsider company has the means and creativity to come at the industry with a fresh perspective and rethink the whole thing, there&#x2019;s often a huge opportunity there.</p> <p>When the iPhone came out, it turned the phone industry on its head. So should we be surprised that when the Tesla Model S came out, Consumer Reports <a href="http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2015/04/consumer-reports-10-top-picks-of-2015/index.htm" target="_blank">anointed it</a> the best car that had ever been made with an unheard of 99/100 rating, and that Tesla owners are <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/Business/In-Gear/2014/1205/Tesla-Model-S-leads-the-pack-in-customer-satisfaction.-Again." target="_blank">across-the-board</a> obsessed with the car? No, because it&#x2019;s like the iPhone&#x2014;it&#x2019;s a 15-year leap into the future.<a href="#footnote2-32-3667" id="note2-32-3667" rel="footnote2">32</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6667.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3830" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/6667.jpg" alt="6667" width="600" height="367"></a></p> <p>The Model S is the fastest 4-door sedan in history, with 3.2-second 0-60 time. It saves battery power by being insanely aerodynamic with the industry&#x2019;s lowest drag coefficient (.24). A bunch of engineering innovations have combined to give it the <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/08/19/tesla-model-s-highest-safety-rating/" target="_blank">highest NHTSA safety rating</a> of any car ever tested by the US government, 5.4 stars.</p> <p>The Model S is already <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=17&amp;v=EJmhpgW0Dmc" target="_blank">driving itself</a> and soon, it&#x2019;ll be able to drive itself to meet you out in the driveway in the morning with the temperature already set and the right music on; at night, you&#x2019;ll be able to pull up to the house and just get out of the car and the car will park itself into the garage and <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2894345/Tesla-teases-electric-car-plugs-charge-Elon-Musk-describes-metal-snake-automatically-connects-vehicles.html" target="_blank">plug itself in</a>. They did away with model years (i.e. the 2014 Toyota Camry, the 2015 Toyota Camry, etc.), so instead of holding all the year&#x2019;s new features until the new release, they just put features in as they go. Someone who buys a Tesla today might have a slightly different car than someone who bought one two weeks ago. And they&#x2019;re constantly rolling out fixes and new features through automatic wifi software updates&#x2014;owners often wake up in the morning to discover the car has a new capability.</p> <p>In a bunch of cases, Tesla has wanted to do something that wasn&#x2019;t technically possible with the current world or industry limitations&#x2014;so they&#x2019;d build what they needed to build to change those limitations:</p> <p>The Tesla battery is heavy and they wanted to make the body super light to offset some of that weight&#x2014;so they turned to SpaceX and used its advanced rocket technology to make Tesla the only North American car with an all aluminum body.</p> <p>Musk and von Holzhausen&#x2019;s<a href="#footnote-22-3667" id="note-22-3667" rel="footnote">22</a> team had spent all this time perfecting the design of the car before it was time to put the door handles on, and they got really used to it that way. When it was time for handles, they didn&#x2019;t want to ruin how it was, so they figured out how to make the handles lay <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIU73kK7ZUk" target="_blank">flush</a> with the door.</p> <p>They didn&#x2019;t like the dealership model and wanted to sell directly to customers, but many states don&#x2019;t allow that, so one by one, they&#x2019;re <a href="http://my.teslamotors.com/fr_CH/forum/forums/where-can-tesla-sell-cars" target="_blank">fighting</a> the states that won&#x2019;t and slowly overturning direct car sales bans.</p> <p>They wanted to get rid of buttons altogether and have all controls on a huge, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVsHEZivqm8" target="_blank">17&#x2033; touchscreen</a>&#x2014;but when their first car came out, there was no iPad yet, and 17&#x2033; touchscreens suitable for a car didn&#x2019;t exist. So they built their own.<a href="#footnote2-33-3667" id="note2-33-3667" rel="footnote2">33</a> </p><p>Innovations like these helped make the Tesla a standout car, but there were still questions around the major shortcomings of EV cars. Of the three EV concerns we listed earlier, AC Propulsion had made significant headway on two&#x2014;performance and battery range&#x2014;and the Tesla team had picked it up from there and had continued to improve both. Performance was now the best in the world for a sedan and the battery range&#x2014;between 208 and 270 miles per charge, depending on the model&#x2014;was excellent.</p> <p>But there were still two problematic questions that needed to be addressed:</p> <p>Can you take a road trip? And can anyone afford the car? Tesla is working on both.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How Tesla is solving the road trip problem:</strong></span></p> <p>With a 200+ range, the Tesla battery has plenty of juice to get most people through the day on any normal day. Even a busy day of commuting and errands and exploration rarely gets close to 200 miles driving. But on long city-to-city drives or road trips, EVs have always had an issue. So Musk came up with a solution:</p> <p>Build a worldwide energy network. Tesla came up with the <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/videos/tesla-motors-supercharger-event" target="_blank">Supercharger</a>&#x2014;a high-caliber, on-the-road charger&#x2014;and there would be public stations that would contain a whole row of Superchargers, just like a row of gas pumps at a gas station. A normal garage charger takes either 5 or 10 hours to fully charge the Model S battery, depending on which type of in-car charging system you opted for. Clearly no one wants to stop for multiple hours while on the road to accomplish what a gas car can by stopping for five minutes&#x2014;so the Supercharger goes much faster. It can charge a Model S at a rate that gives it about 60 miles of range for every 10 minutes of charging time. So if you&#x2019;re driving between Boston and New York (215 miles), you might make it with no stopping, but if you did need to stop, you could just charge up for 5 or 10 minutes&#x2014;not that much more than a stop for gas. Driving from LA to San Francisco (382 miles), you&#x2019;d need to stop for 20 or 30 minutes.</p> <p>And the thing is&#x2014;on a 4-hour drive from Boston to New York, isn&#x2019;t a 5-10 minute stop desirable anyway? On a 6-7 hour drive from LA to SF, wouldn&#x2019;t most people stop for 20-30 minutes to get some food and go to the bathroom anyway?</p> <p>The more I thought about this, the more I realized how little of an issue range is for an EV with a good battery like the Tesla. Just say you do a long drive five days a year. That means on 360 of the 365 days, you have to do nothing. You just drive, and <em>you never need to stop at a gas station.</em> And the other five days? You&#x2019;d probably just need to stop for about as long as you would stop on a long drive anyway.</p> <p>Seems like a perfect solution, but you need to have a Supercharger along <em>your </em>drive if it&#x2019;s going to work. Here&#x2019;s where Superchargers are today in the US:<a href="#footnote2-34-3667" id="note2-34-3667" rel="footnote2">34</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-US-14.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3742" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-US-14.jpg" alt="Supercharger US 14" width="600" height="286"></a></p> <p>And they&#x2019;re building them at a furious pace&#x2014;here&#x2019;s where they&#x2019;ll be by the end of 2016:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Supercharger-US-16-compressor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3820" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Supercharger-US-16-compressor.jpg" alt="Supercharger-US-16-compressor" width="600" height="284"></a></p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-Europe.jpg" target="_blank">Europe</a> and <a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Supercharger-Asia.jpg" target="_blank">Asia</a> will be equally well-covered.</p> <p>For now, only Teslas can use the Supercharger stations, and only the Tesla can really make long-distance drives right now anyway. But down the road, Musk plans to partner with other EV car companies so any EV can stop at one.</p> <p>A couple other things about Superchargers: they&#x2019;re all free to use, and soon, they&#x2019;ll all be entirely solar-powered. Musk jokes that if there&#x2019;s a zombie apocalypse, Tesla owners will be fine because they won&#x2019;t need the grid to fuel their car. And it means that if you had friends to stay with, you could technically drive across the US without taking a wallet.</p> <p>This is also going to become even easier with time, because Tesla is making new innovations every year. For example, the Roadster now has a 350 mile range battery and you can just about do LA to SF without stopping&#x2014;it&#x2019;s only a matter of time before their cheaper cars have a similar range. Tesla also recently <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/videos/battery-swap-event" target="_blank">unveiled</a> a new Supercharger feature&#x2014;<strong>the battery swap</strong>. A Tesla driver will be able to pull up to a little rectangle and stop the car. The ground opens up and a machine comes out and takes the car&#x2019;s battery off, brings up a fresh battery and puts it on, and you&#x2019;re good to go&#x2014;<em>all in 90 seconds</em>. This would cost $60-80, or as much as an expensive tank of gas&#x2014;so Tesla drivers would now have the option of &#x201C;fast or free.&#x201D;</p> <p>So with that problem very close to being out of the way, Tesla seems to only have one issue left:</p> <p><em>Who the hell can afford a $75,000 car? </em></p> <p>The starting price of a Tesla Model S is technically $69,900. But if you want the higher-range cars and the faster charging battery, the price jumps up. There are a bunch of other &#x201C;well shit now that you mention it yeah I do want that too&#x201D; features, and a Model S can quickly work its way toward the $100,000 mark.</p> <p>Musk is always quick to point out that for the moment, the US offers a $7,500 tax credit for buying an EV of sufficient range. He also points out what I mentioned above about the $2,000-ish a year gas savings. Sure&#x2014;but even subtracting all that, we&#x2019;re around $55,000 for a Tesla Model S, which is prohibitive for most people. Tesla has a new car coming out soon&#x2014;their SUV with <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/modelx" target="_blank">Falcon Wing doors</a>, called the Model X&#x2014;but it&#x2019;s another Step 2, mid-price / mid-volume expensive car. Doesn&#x2019;t solve the pricing problem.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s a <a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1089555_electric-car-market-share-in-2013-understanding-the-numbers-better" target="_blank">rule of thumb</a> in the car world that every $5,000 decrease in car price approximately doubles the number of buyers who can afford the car. So if Tesla can somehow come out with a stellar EV for about $35,000 less than the Model S, it would double the buyer pool 7 times, or multiply it by 125-fold. Which would now mean <em>most</em> people could afford it. Let&#x2019;s bring back Tesla&#x2019;s Hershey&#x2019;s Kiss business plan from earlier:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3792" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/pyramid2.png" alt="pyramid2" width="550" height="414"></a></p> <p>So Step 3 is what this is all about. Step 3 is why Tesla exists and if Tesla ends up changing the world, it&#x2019;ll be because of Step 3.</p> <p>That car is the Model 3, and it&#x2019;s coming out in 2017. Supposedly. And it&#x2019;ll cost $35,000&#x2014;$27,500 after the tax credit, and after taking gas savings into account, under $20,000. Supposedly.</p> <p>But <em>how? </em>Right now, the Model 3 battery costs around $20,000. Even if Tesla ditches the high-tech aluminum body, makes the car smaller, and ditches some of the fanciest things about the Model S, the battery pack alone makes a price like $35,000 impossible.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>How Tesla is solving the high-price problem:</strong></span></p> <p>Big problems call for big solutions. To solve the range problem, Tesla is building a worldwide energy network of Superchargers. And to solve the price problem, they&#x2019;re building this:<a href="#footnote2-35-3667" id="note2-35-3667" rel="footnote2">35</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hero-compressor.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3821" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/hero-compressor.jpg" alt="hero-compressor" width="800" height="375"></a></p> <p>That&#x2019;s what Musk has named the <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/gigafactory" target="_blank">Gigafactory</a>. It&#x2019;s a $5 billion lithium-ion battery factory, currently being built in Nevada. The factory will be self-sufficient, powered entirely by on-site solar, wind, and geothermal energy, and it will employ 6,500 people.</p> <p>Right now, the world&#x2019;s combined annual output of lithium-ion batteries is 30GWh&#x2014;mostly for use in laptops and mobile phones. The Gigafactory will make more than that each year, which means it will <em>more than double the total lithium-ion batteries made each year globally</em>. There are two huge benefits to doing this:</p> <p>First, Tesla is planning to ramp up production of their cars until they&#x2019;re producing 500,000 of them a year, and they&#x2019;re going to need a lot of lithium-ion batteries when they do. Musk&#x2019;s reasoning is simple: &#x201C;I know we can&#x2019;t get enough lithium-ion batteries unless we build this bloody factory, and I know no one else is building this thing.&#x201D; The numbers make this necessity clear. To make enough batteries for their planned 500,000 cars a year, Tesla will need about 30GWh of lithium-ion batteries a year&#x2014;the current world output&#x2014;meaning that without building the Gigafactory, they&#x2019;d have to use every single lithium-ion battery in the world. Tesla&#x2019;s Gigafactory will just barely cover Tesla&#x2019;s needs&#x2014;if a day comes when every car company is making a ton of EVs, there will need to be many Gigafactories built by many companies.</p> <p>Second, by both doubling the world supply of lithium-ion batteries and by continuing to innovate with battery technology, Tesla&#x2019;s work at the Gigafactory will make batteries a lot cheaper. Musk says the price of the battery should go down by <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/corporate-intelligence/2014/05/14/the-logic-of-teslas-gigafactory-the-economics-are-a-no-brainer/" target="_blank">at least 30%</a>. Right now, Musk says Tesla could make their cars with a <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2014/07/26/elon-musk-says-500-mile-ev-happen-soon/" target="_blank">500 mile range</a>&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t do it because it would increase the cost of the car. But as battery prices go down, EV ranges will go up as well.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m pretty convinced that the Model S is the best expensive car ever made. In its first year, its sales blew away its well-known direct competitors&#x2014;the S-Class Mercedes, BMW 7-Series, the Lexus LS, and the Audi A8&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s been in the lead ever since. But those cars all play in a small space for the very rich.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s the Model 3 that will turn the industry on its head. You may not know much about Tesla today&#x2014;or particularly care&#x2014;but I&#x2019;m pretty sure everyone will know about the Model 3 soon. Maybe that&#x2019;s why Musk refuses to do any advertising&#x2014;because he knows that when the Model 3 comes out, he won&#x2019;t have to.</p> <p>The market has taken notice. Tesla&#x2019;s $226 million IPO in June of 2010 marks the first IPO for an American car company since Ford went public in 1956. Since then, the company&#x2019;s value has soared upwards. Today, seven years after being on the brink of bankruptcy, Tesla&#x2019;s <a href="https://www.google.com/finance?q=NASDAQ:TSLA" target="_blank">market cap</a> is a massive $31 billion. To put in perspective how big a deal that is, I set Tesla&#x2019;s path to that number down on a graph with the Big Three US automakers (just using straight lines to simplify):</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Car-Graphs.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3829" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Car-Graphs.jpg" alt="Car Graphs" width="638" height="399"></a></p> <p>The car industry forest canopy has been pretty stagnant for a long time, and for decades, no hungry underdog has been able to make a run at it. Tesla hasn&#x2019;t cracked the canopy yet, but for the first time in a long time, there&#x2019;s a new company bolting upwards from the ground at lightning speed.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>A Ripple Effect</strong></span></p> <p>If you&#x2019;re another one of the big car companies, and you&#x2019;ve been around for decades, and you&#x2019;re comfortably doing your thing, making slight incremental improvements each year to your existing line of cars&#x2014;could <em>anything in the world</em> be more annoying than Tesla?</p> <p>Remember, the car companies know alllll about electric cars and their benefits. Most of them made an electric car in the 1990s when California mandated that they do, and then the second the mandate went away, they confiscated and literally <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Who_Killed_the_Electric_Car%3F" target="_blank">crushed</a> the cars. Then they whipped the cars into the dump and covered the pile with a tablecloth with a &#x201C;nothing to see here folks&#x201D; look on their faces. The scare was over and they could go back to their comfort zone, incrementally improving their gas vehicles.</p> <p>Their feelings on EVs make perfect sense:</p> <p>Dealerships make a huge amount of profit fixing gas engines, oil filters, and doing oil changes&#x2014;money they&#x2019;d stop making when they sold EVs with motors that rarely broke.</p> <p>The car companies already know gas cars back and forth, and they&#x2019;ve mastered the art of making a few tiny new changes to them each year so the new year&#x2019;s models will be a little better than the previous year&#x2019;s. But EVs are a new world for them, and they don&#x2019;t know any more about how to make a good powertrain or improve battery energy density than Tesla does&#x2014;in fact, they know less, as evidenced by Toyota and Mercedes both buying the Tesla powertrain for their EVs. What a pain in the ass all that R&amp;D would be.</p> <p>Most importantly, the world already wants to buy gas cars. There&#x2019;s no convincing needed&#x2014;just a few standard TV ads to hone the latest phase of the brand&#x2019;s image and inform customers about the latest product updates. But EVs are new and scary to customers, and there&#x2019;s a hump to get over in educating the world about why they should buy one. But the <em>really </em>problematic thing about this is that in order to market an EV well, you need to do what I&#x2019;m doing in this post and explain all the reasons EVs are obviously a huge step forward from gas cars&#x2014;which simultaneously sends the message, &#x201C;Gas cars are dirty, inconvenient, and old-fashioned.&#x201D; Not a thing you want to do when your current bread and butter is selling 10 million gas cars a year.</p> <p>And who wants to deal with all of these things when they could just skip it <i>if Tesla would just go away.</i></p> <p>Franz von Holzhausen has worked at three of these other companies. The way he sees it, &#x201C;they&#x2019;re trapped in their manufacturing legacy process, trapped in gas engines being their bread and butter, trapped in their dealership model, trapped in their own history.&#x201D;</p> <p>Musk explains it as a lack of guts and originality: &#x201C;The big car companies are so derivative. They want to see it work somewhere else before they will approve the project and move forward.&#x201D;<a href="#footnote2-36-3667" id="note2-36-3667" rel="footnote2">36</a> </p><p>But the Tesla tree is racing upwards, and its impending burst through the canopy has successfully scared the industry. We know this for sure, because when the first Tesla Roadster shipped in 2008, there were <em>no </em>big company EVs on the market. Today, Ford, Chevy, Nissan, BMW, Mercedes, Volkswagen, Fiat, Kia, Mitsubishi, and Smart <em>all </em><a href="http://www.plugincars.com/cars" target="_blank">have an EV</a> on the road. Not a coincidence.</p> <p>So what&#x2019;s the deal with all of these other EVs?</p> <p>Most notable is the <a href="http://plugincars.com/nissan-leaf" target="_blank">Nissan Leaf</a>, introduced in 2010, which has been the highest-selling EV in the world in recent years (though the much more expensive Tesla Model S has topped the industry in EVs sold <a href="http://insideevs.com/monthly-plug-in-sales-scorecard/" target="_blank">so far in 2015</a>). The Leaf costs about $30,000 ($22,500 after tax credit) and has a range of 84 miles. Nissan CEO Carlos Ghosn has for a while been one of the few strongly pro-EV voices in the car industry outside of Tesla. He <a href="http://www.greencarreports.com/news/1095851_electric-cars-win-for-4-reasons-says-nissans-carlos-ghosn" target="_blank">talks about</a> the &#x201C;cul-de-sac&#x201D; effect that will begin to accelerate EV sales&#x2014;i.e. people will be jealous that their neighbor has a more futuristic car and doesn&#x2019;t have to get gas, will ask questions, and then might get one themselves.</p> <p>The recently introduced <a href="http://plugincars.com/bmw-i3.html" target="_blank">BMW i3</a> is currently selling next best after the Leaf and Model S. It costs $43,000 ($35,500 after tax credit) and has a range of 81 miles. BMW CEO Norbert Reithofer has jumped on the EV train, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323854904578635543525172364" target="_blank">saying</a>, &#x201C;You have to look into the future, 10, 15, 20 years&#x2026;cars like the BMW i3 are a must.&#x201D;</p> <p>No other EV has had significant sales yet.<a href="#footnote-23-3667" id="note-23-3667" rel="footnote">23</a> I asked Musk about the Leaf and the i3. About the Leaf, he said, &#x201C;The range is too low, but if they keep iterating on that, they&#x2019;ll eventually get there.&#x201D; On the i3: &#x201C;They&#x2019;re trying to do something there. The range is low, but it&#x2019;s a step in the right direction, and if they keep going, they&#x2019;ll get something there.&#x201D;</p> <p>This &#x201C;Congrats on your first big boy toilet poop, Johnny, now next time try to get the whole thing inside the bowl and you&#x2019;ll be on your way!&#x201D; tone is about as effusive as Musk gets when assessing the industry&#x2019;s current attempts at an EV.</p> <p>Volkswagen just hired BMW&#x2019;s ex-CEO and also <a href="http://evobsession.com/300-mile-electric-cars-vw-exec/" target="_blank">seems to be</a> bullish on EVs, and GM is promising big things with their upcoming EV, the Chevy Bolt.</p> <p>Other car companies still aren&#x2019;t convinced. Mercedes CEO Dieter Zetsche <a href="http://ecomento.com/2015/04/02/mercedes-ceo-dieter-zetsche-looks-at-the-electric-car-future/" target="_blank">said</a> he doesn&#x2019;t expect EVs to sell well for a while, because &#x201C;the customer gets a car with less range, longer refueling times, somewhat less space, and a higher price tag.&#x201D; The major Japanese companies, Toyota and Honda, are both skeptical about EVs and have been pouring their future into hybrids and hydrogen cars instead. Fiat Chrysler CEO Sergio Marchionne is so anti-EV that he&#x2019;s told the world <em>not </em>to buy their Fiat 500e EV, saying they&#x2019;re only selling it because regulations have forced them to.</p> <p>If EVs are the dominant car of the future, they have a long way to go to get there. As of January 2015, there were a total of <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2015/03/28/ev-demand-growing-global-market-hits-740000-units/" target="_blank">740,000</a> EVs on the road worldwide. Compare that to the whole picture of over 80 million cars sold worldwide annually and over a billion total cars on the road. EVs make up only a fraction of a percent of the car industry. But they&#x2019;re on the move:<a href="#footnote2-37-3667" id="note2-37-3667" rel="footnote2">37</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ev-fleet-count.png"><img class="  wp-image-3710 aligncenter" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ev-fleet-count.png" alt="ev-fleet-count" width="532" height="352"></a></p> <p>So we&#x2019;re either at the cusp of a new EV-dominated car era or in the middle of another little EV bubble before they vanish from existence <em>again</em>&#x2014;and as you can see from the quotes above, the car industry is currently divided in which way they&#x2019;re betting.</p> <p>I think we&#x2019;ll learn a lot more soon, because the world is still yet to see its first true potential EV disruptor. The issue with Tesla right now is most people can&#x2019;t afford one, and the issue with <em>every </em>other EV is the range sucks. It looks like this:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plot.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3775" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Plot.png" alt="Plot" width="500" height="471"></a></p> <p>The truth is, the typical American drives <a href="http://www.facethefactsusa.org/facts/the-asphalts-getting-crowded-video-" target="_blank">37 miles a day</a> on average, and the 80+ mile range options are probably actually plenty for most people. But 80 miles seems like an insufficient range to prospective buyers, and mass adoption won&#x2019;t happen with that kind of range.</p> <p>Tesla&#x2019;s plan all along was to plant a stellar car right in that Quadrant 4 box, and that&#x2019;s what they say they&#x2019;re going to do in 2017 when the Model 3 comes out. A number of other carmakers, including <a href="http://www.leftlanenews.com/nissan-leaf-2017.html" target="_blank">Nissan</a>, <a href="http://evobsession.com/300-mile-electric-cars-vw-exec/" target="_blank">Volkswagen</a>, and <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2015/01/14/what-mary-barras-growth-strategy-says-about-the-new-gm/" target="_blank">GM</a> have all declared their intention to release a not-that-expensive long-range EV soon. It&#x2019;s not clear if any or all of these companies will get into Quadrant 4, but if they do&#x2026;</p> <p>If there are high-quality, affordable EVs for sale that also have a high range&#x2026;</p> <p><strong>I cannot think of <em>one </em>reason <em>anyone </em>would <em>ever </em>buy a gas car again.</strong></p> <p>A Tesla-quality car that&#x2019;s affordable to the middle class would seem to have only pros in the Pro/Con list:</p> <p><strong>Pros of an affordable, high-quality, long-range EV over a comparable gas car:</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Drives better. </strong>The instant torque of an EV is like exploding out of a gun. There&#x2019;s no lag time between your foot touching the pedal and the car moving. Without gears, it accelerates perfectly smoothly. The handling is incredible. It&#x2019;s silent.</li> <li><strong>More convenient. </strong>No stops for gas. Much less need to take the car in for maintenance. No oil changes. More storage because with no engine, the hood is now the frunk (the front trunk).</li> <li><strong>Safer. </strong>With no engine, the entire front of the car becomes a crumple zone. That&#x2019;s part of why the Model S has blown away the safety ratings.</li> <li><strong>Cheaper. </strong>No gas or oil, and less maintenance. No longer beholden to fluctuating gas prices.</li> <li><strong>Healthier. </strong>No smog in cities, which cause <a href="http://www.healthline.com/health/dangers-smog-what-you-need-know-about-air-pollution#2" target="_blank">many, many health problems.</a></li> <li><strong>Oh yeah, and the whole thing about avoiding an environmental, economic, or geopolitical catastrophe.</strong></li> </ul> <p><strong>Cons of an affordable, high-quality, long-range EV over a comparable gas car:</strong></p> <ul> <li>People who love to shift the manual stick around with all their muscle because they&#x2019;re a cool cat on the open road to destiny can&#x2019;t do that.</li> <li>Five days a year, when you&#x2019;re on a long drive, you have to stop for 30 minutes every three hours instead of five minutes every four hours&#x2014;a con that becomes moot if you would have stopped for 30 minutes anyway every few hours.</li> </ul> <p>EVs aren&#x2019;t there yet. Right now, there are legit cons. But as the next few years pass, EVs will get cheaper, battery ranges will get longer and longer, Superchargers will pop up more and more until they&#x2019;re everywhere, and charging times will just decrease as technology advances. Maybe I&#x2019;m missing something, and I&#x2019;m sure a bunch of seething commenters will try to make that very clear to me, but it seems like a given to me: the gas era is over and EVs are the obvious, <em>obvious </em>future.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 16pt;"><strong>An Angry Giant</strong></span></p> <p>The car companies, as I mentioned, aren&#x2019;t happy about all of this&#x2014;they&#x2019;re acting like a kid with a cupcake whose parents are forcing them to eat their vegetables.</p> <p>But how about the oil industry?</p> <p>Unlike car companies, the oil industry can&#x2019;t suck it up, get on the EV train, and after an unpleasant hump, continue to thrive. If EVs catch on in a serious way and end up being the ubiquitous type of car, oil companies are ruined. 45% of all the world&#x2019;s extracted oil is used for transportation, but in the developed world, it&#x2019;s much higher&#x2014;in the US, 71% of extracted oil is used for transportation, and most of that is for cars.</p> <p>So if the car industry has a cupcake and its parents are forcing it to eat vegetables, the oil industry has a cupcake but <i>its </i>parents are forcing it to eat <em>razor blades.</em> The car industry will resist the veggies and have a little tantrum before grudgingly giving in&#x2014;the oil industry will <em>furiously try to gouge the parents&#x2019; eyes out in resistance </em>because for him, this is life and death.</p> <p>And that&#x2019;s how the oil industry sees EVs&#x2014;horrifying razor blades. And giant industries don&#x2019;t just roll over and eat razor blades without a serious fight.</p> <p>We&#x2019;ve seen this before. Tobacco companies fought tooth and nail to stay alive and strong as long as possible when the tide started to turn against them. And the oil industry itself has been fighting tooth and nail for a while now on another front&#x2014;the battle to keep people confused about whether global warming is a thing.</p> <p>Usually in these cases, the industry clawing for survival knows it&#x2019;s on the way out. But in the meantime, they&#x2019;re making money, and the longer it takes before the public fully gets the situation, the longer it&#x2019;ll be before the public uniformly rejects them, politicians are able to regulate against them, and the money finally stops. Time is very much money in these situations.</p> <p>The tactic to stay alive longer is always the same&#x2014;put out misinformation to create confusion, and make it political so half the country feels like they&#x2019;re going against &#x201C;their own team&#x201D; if they side against the industry.</p> <p>The super-clever way they create confusion is by generating the public perception that there&#x2019;s a genuine debate among scientists. That&#x2019;s how you make a 97% consensus seem like an open question:<a href="#footnote2-38-3667" id="note2-38-3667" rel="footnote2">38</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/consensus_gap.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3708" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/consensus_gap.jpg" alt="consensus_gap" width="563" height="422"></a></p> <p>The same tactic was used a few decades ago when 98% of scientists said smoking caused lung cancer, but the tobacco industry convinced the public for a long time that &#x201C;scientists disagree&#x201D; about whether smoking is harmful. The book <em>Merchants of Doubt</em> details how many of the same pro-smoking &#x201C;scientists&#x201D; a generation later became the &#x201C;global warming isn&#x2019;t a thing&#x201D; scientists&#x2014;the actual same <em>people.</em></p> <p>When the 1990 California Zero Emissions Mandate forced car companies to make an EV in order to continue selling cars in CA, the oil industry saw it as a small tumor they needed to swiftly nip in the bud before it grew into a serious threat. Soon, a new voice popped up, a grassroots campaign called &#x201C;Californians Against Utility Company Abuse&#x201D; (CAUCA). The campaign staged protests against the state&#x2019;s proposed utility investments in alternative-vehicle support systems. They also mentioned that &#x201C;the environmental benefits of electric cars were dubious&#x201D;<a href="#footnote2-39-3667" id="note2-39-3667" rel="footnote2">39</a> But as it turns out, CAUCA was created by a PR firm who was hired and funded by the oil industry. Eventually, the mandate was repealed, EVs disappeared, and the tumor was squashed.</p> <p>Now, there&#x2019;s a new tumor for the oil industry&#x2014;Elon Musk. Tesla is showing the public directly that EVs are the future and funding the development of technology that&#x2019;s making EVs better than anyone thought possible. A government mandate is crushable&#x2014;obsessed Model S owners are not.</p> <p>But again, oil doesn&#x2019;t need to avoid an EV future to have a reason to fight&#x2014;it just needs to <em>delay </em>the EV future for <em>as long as it possibly can. </em>Tesla&#x2019;s mission is &#x201C;to accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible.&#x201D; Big oil&#x2019;s current mission is &#x201C;to <em>delay </em>the advent of sustainable transport by making people think EVs aren&#x2019;t actually better for the environment than gas cars.&#x201D;</p> <p>EVs are most definitely better for the environment&#x2014;so the oil industry reaches for a key tool.</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BS-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3832" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/BS-2.png" alt="BS 2" width="450" height="322"></a></p> <p>There are now a bunch of myths floating around. I didn&#x2019;t treat them like automatic myths&#x2014;each time I heard an argument for why EVs are dirty, I dug in and read about it, but each time, there was little basis in fact. Some examples of myths I&#x2019;ve seen floating around about EVs or Tesla in particular:</p> <p><strong>Myth: </strong>EV battery disposal is <a href="http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2012/01/09/electric-car-subsidies-transferring-wealth-from-poor-to-rich/" target="_blank">hazardous</a>.</p> <p><strong>Actually: </strong>A) Lithium-ion cells used in cars aren&#x2019;t especially hazardous and are classified as landfill safe, B) They&#x2019;re almost all recycled anyway, and C) They&#x2019;ll continue to be recycled, because a used car battery still has a lot of value, either as a stationary battery or in the raw materials themselves.</p> <p><strong>Myth: </strong>Manufacturing a Tesla is much dirtier than manufacturing a Prius or many other gas cars.</p> <p><strong>Actually: </strong>Expensive cars are dirtier to manufacture than cheap ones. Comparing the manufacturing of a Tesla to a Prius is like saying &#x201C;Prius&#x2019;s are dirty because it&#x2019;s dirtier to manufacture a Prius than a golf cart.&#x201D; If you compare apples to apples, it&#x2019;s no dirtier to make a Tesla than a similarly-priced luxury car.</p> <p><strong>Myth: </strong>EVs are a huge burden on the electric grid.</p> <p><strong>Actually: </strong>The grid is sized for the worst second of the worst day of the worst year&#x2014;so there&#x2019;s usually a lot of excess capacity. You could replace 70% of US gas car miles with EV miles with no changes to the grid. That percentage will also grow even higher as more homes get their power from solar panels.</p> <p><strong>Myth: </strong>The Tesla uses a lot of graphite in their battery, which <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-03-14/teslas-in-california-help-bring-dirty-rain-to-china" target="_blank">contributes</a> to China&#x2019;s pollution problem.</p> <p><strong>Actually: </strong>The logic here is: &#x201C;Tesla batteries use graphite; the world&#x2019;s biggest source of graphite is in China; China has terrible pollution; therefore, Tesla is partially responsible for China&#x2019;s pollution.&#x201D; Except when I did some digging, I learned that Tesla uses synthetic graphite made mostly in Japan and Poland, and that the average Model S uses 100kg of it. That 100kg lasts for ten years, so the amount of graphite used to make a Model S is similar to the amount you&#x2019;d use if you had a few barbecues a year.</p> <p>But there&#x2019;s one myth which has been more effective and more pervasive than any of these&#x2014;<strong>the long tailpipe theory.</strong></p> <p>The long tailpipe theory is everywhere. Anyone who doesn&#x2019;t like EVs points it out immediately. So what&#x2019;s the theory? I&#x2019;ll let Fox News&#x2019; Greg Gutfeld do the honors:</p> <p>&#x201C;The entire reason for doing these stupid little cars is a lie because electricity comes from coal. In some cases, some studies show that these can produce more pollution than internal combustion engines.&#x201D;<a href="#footnote2-40-3667" id="note2-40-3667" rel="footnote2">40</a> </p><p>Upon first examination, this makes sense. Let&#x2019;s bring back our US emissions chart to see what Greg means:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/US-Emissions-2013-2.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3768" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/US-Emissions-2013-2.png" alt="US Emissions 2013 2" width="900" height="515"></a></p> <p>Earlier in the post, we identified the two biggest causes of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions: cars running on gas and coal making electricity. The long tailpipe theory&#x2019;s logic is that all an EV does is shift energy production from the first bad category to the second bad category. Since coal is the most prominent source of electricity in the world, and coal emits about 1.5 times more carbon per joule of energy produced, EVs are actually worse emissions culprits than gas cars.</p> <p>When you read about EVs or talk to people about them, you&#x2019;ll hear this theory come up <a href="http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/jan/17/unplug-the-volt/" target="_blank">again</a> and <a href="http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-08-10/opinion/ct-oped-0810-goldberg-20100810_1_electric-cars-chevy-volt-ev1" target="_blank">again</a> and <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/102273164" target="_blank">again</a> and <a href="http://www.naturalnews.com/049504_electric_cars_ethanol_greenwashing.html#" target="_blank">again</a>.</p> <p>The thing you&#x2019;ll notice, though, is that every time you hear someone all mad about the long tailpipe emissions of EVs, they&#x2019;re using wording like, &#x201C;may be&#x201D; and &#x201C;often&#x201D; and, in the case of Greg, &#x201C;in some cases, some studies show.&#x201D; That&#x2019;s because you have to use words like that when you&#x2019;re saying things that you wish were true but actually aren&#x2019;t.</p> <p>Taking the US as an example, here&#x2019;s why they&#x2019;re wrong:</p> <p><strong>1) US electricity production is mixed, not just coal. </strong>Coal only makes up 39% of US electricity production. And that number&#x2019;s going down:<a href="#footnote2-41-3667" id="note2-41-3667" rel="footnote2">41</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.56.42-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3818" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.56.42-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 4.56.42 PM" width="633" height="302"></a></p> <p>Natural gas, which emits less than half the CO<sub>2</sub> of coal, now makes up over a quarter of US electricity production. Nuclear and renewables emit almost no CO<sub>2</sub> and now produce a third of US electricity.</p> <p><strong>2) Energy production is more efficient in a power plant than it is in a car engine. </strong>To use an example with an identical source fuel, burning natural gas in a power plant is about <a href="http://www.npc.org/study_topic_papers/4-dtg-electricefficiency.pdf" target="_blank">60% efficient</a>, meaning 40% of the energy of the fuel is lost in the energy production process. In a car, burning gas is less than 25% efficient, with the vast majority of the energy lost to heat. The larger more complex system at a power plant will always be far better at capturing waste heat than a tiny car engine. The increased efficiency means that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">even a car running <em>purely </em>on coal-generated electricity will emit carbon at the same rate as a gas car that gets 30 miles per gallon</span>&#x2014;which would be a significantly cleaner-than-average gas car.</p> <p>Because the breakdown of energy source is different in different states, an EV will be greener in some places than others. The US Department of Energy has a <a href="http://www.afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/electric_emissions.php" target="_blank">great tool</a> to assess exactly how an EV stacks up against a gas car in any zip code in the country.</p> <p>In the parts of the country that use very little coal, like upstate New York, an EV&#x2019;s well-to-wheel emissions are <em>far </em>less than that of a gas car (on the chart, HEV = a traditional hybrid car, PHEV = a plug-in hybrid car):</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.05.59-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3724" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.05.59-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.05.59 PM" width="601" height="268"></a></p> <p>In the heaviest coal states, like Colorado, EVs cause a lot more CO<sub>2</sub> emissions&#x2014;but still less than a gas car:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.04.39-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3723" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.04.39-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.04.39 PM" width="600" height="270"></a></p> <p>The national average is somewhere in between, putting an EV at 61% of a gas car&#x2019;s emissions overall:</p> <p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.06.20-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3725" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-6.06.20-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 6.06.20 PM" width="600" height="262"></a></p> <p><a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/legacy/assets/documents/clean_vehicles/electric-car-global-warming-emissions-report.pdf" target="_blank">The Union of Concerned Scientists</a><a href="#footnote-24-3667" id="note-24-3667" rel="footnote">24</a> came up with a way to directly compare car emissions, regardless of the type of car it is&#x2014;a metric called &#x201C;miles per gallon equivalent,&#x201D; or MPG<sub>ghg</sub> (ghg stands for greenhouse gases).</p> <p>MPG<sub>ghg</sub> is how many miles per gallon a gas car would need to achieve in order to match the carbon emissions of an EV (in the EV&#x2019;s case, the emissions come from the plant that makes the electricity). In other words, if an EV gets 40 MPG<sub>ghg</sub>, it means it emits the exact same amount of carbon as a gas car that gets 40 MPG.</p> <p>The average new gas car gets 23 MPG. Anything above 30 MPG is really good for a gas car, and anything below 15 or 17 is bad. For reference, remember that an EV running on <em>just </em>coal would have an MPG<sub>ghg </sub>of 30 (so even in a hypothetical entirely coal-powered state, an EV would be the same as a highly efficient gas car), and an EV running on just natural gas-powered electricity would have an MPG<sub>ghg</sub> of 54 and just top the Toyota Prius, which runs at 50 MPG.</p> <p>Here&#x2019;s a useful map that shows the kind of MPG<sub>ghg</sub> EVs get in different parts of the US:<a href="#footnote2-42-3667" id="note2-42-3667" rel="footnote2">42</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MPG-Map.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3828" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/MPG-Map.jpg" alt="MPG Map" width="738" height="822"></a></p> <p>So even for the 17% of the population living in the worst coal states, an EV beats almost all gas cars. This sums it up:<a href="#footnote2-43-3667" id="note2-43-3667" rel="footnote2">43</a> </p><p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.52.33-PM.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-3721" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-28-at-4.52.33-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-05-28 at 4.52.33 PM" width="672" height="197"></a></p> <p>And the thing is, each year, that already-nicely-positioned blue bar will make a little jump to the right. Because the grid is getting cleaner every year, it means an EV gets cleaner as time goes by. Gas cars are locked where they are, and they&#x2019;ll be stuck watching as the future pulls away from them.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">___________</p> <p>I didn&#x2019;t feel strongly about this topic before I spent a lot of recent time learning about it&#x2014;and now that I have, I kind of think the only way someone could feel positive about a gas car future is if they&#x2019;re misinformed, personally financially interested in gas cars, hopelessly old-fashioned, drunk with politics, or kind of just being a dick? Right? They would have to be one of those five things to be super pro-gas car&#x2014;right?</p> <p>The battle going on isn&#x2019;t about gas cars vs. electric cars. That one&#x2019;s already decided. This is a war about time. Oil companies will try to slow things down, and they may succeed&#x2014;but they&#x2019;re not winning this one. I just don&#x2019;t see how they could. A company that makes lantern fuel can stay strong for a while by shielding the public from understanding what a light bulb is, but eventually, people will figure it out and lanterns will be out of business, bringing the lantern fuel company down with it. Greasy hoods are old, noisy acceleration is old, overheating engines are old, oil changes are old, and it won&#x2019;t be long before everyone realizes that. A fun field trip in 2050 will be taking your grandkid to see an old 20th-century gas station and explaining how it worked.<a href="#footnote-25-3667" id="note-25-3667" rel="footnote">25</a> Driving a gas car is like littering on a camping trail, smoking on an airplane, and throwing a big stack of paper in the trash, and it&#x2019;s just a matter of time until public disgust catches up to it.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>Zooming Back Out</strong></span></p> <p>Learning to harness the dragon of fire launched our modern world, and still today, we live in the age of burning. But we need to move on&#x2014;we need to stop plowing through the trust fund and get a job. The dog needs to let the cave go. We need to learn to make energy the adult way&#x2014;sustainably.</p> <p>The sustainable energy world of the future&#x2014;the yellow zone of our <a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/FF-Timeline.png" target="_blank">timeline</a> from earlier in the post&#x2014;is simple. It looks like this:</p> <p><strong>1) Almost everything we use will run on electricity.</strong></p> <p><strong>2) Almost all of our electricity will be produced from sustainable sources.</strong></p> <p>That&#x2019;s a world running on sunlight and electricity, and burning has no part in that world.</p> <p>This transition will happen in steps, over time. At the beginning of the post, we identified the two problems we needed to address most urgently: 1) Electricity production is huge and mostly dirty. 2) Transportation is huge and almost entirely dirty.</p> <p>We spent the rest of the post zoomed in on Problem 2 to examine how things got that way, stayed that way, and why we may be witnessing the moment it finally changes.</p> <p>We won&#x2019;t get into Problem 1 today&#x2014;but both Musk, through the US-leading solar panel installation company he co-founded, <a href="http://www.solarcity.com/" target="_blank">SolarCity</a>, and Tesla, with their new product, the <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/powerwall" target="_blank">Powerwall</a> stationary battery,<a href="#footnote-26-3667" id="note-26-3667" rel="footnote">26</a> are leading the way in this half of the energy equation too. For those interested, I put up a <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/06/the-deal-with-solar.html" target="_blank">mini post</a> on solar power and SolarCity.</p> <p>People don&#x2019;t quite realize it yet, but as of this moment, a family or business has the option to individually move themselves into the sustainable future. Using products made by SolarCity and Tesla alone, you can today live in a home and drive a car that are both powered by a solar panel-connected battery and live entirely on sunlight. Musk and his companies have made a little yellow brick road right out of the Fossil Fuel Era for anyone who wants to leave. And if modern technology can allow individual people, businesses, or even whole cities to live without fossil fuels, it hints that the only era any of us has ever known might be soon coming to an end.</p> <p><span style="font-size: 20pt;"><strong>How to Change the World</strong></span></p> <p>A study of Tesla isn&#x2019;t about a car or a car company&#x2014;it&#x2019;s about how change happens. And about why it often doesn&#x2019;t happen.</p> <p>Our intuition tells us that technology, social norms, movements and ideas just move forward through time, as if forward progress is a river and those things are on a raft gliding through. We so associate the passage of time with progress that we use the term &#x201C;the future&#x201D; to refer to a better, more advanced version of our present world.</p> <p>In reality, if a more advanced future does happen, it&#x2019;s because that future was <em>willed</em> into our lives by a few brave people. The present isn&#x2019;t welcoming of an advanced future because the present is run by a thick canopy made up of the<span class="s1"> ideas, norms, and technologies of the <em>past. </em>There&#x2019;ll be incremental tweaks and slight iterations on proven-to-work concepts, which may <em>seem </em>to us like moving into the future, but it&#x2019;s really just a polishing up of the past.</span></p> <p>When the real change arrives, you know you&#x2019;re seeing it. <span class="s1">It&#x2019;s a distinct and exhilarating feeling when you witness a disrupting innovator ram its way through the canopy. I had that feeling when I watched Steve Jobs <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t4OEsI0Sc_s" target="_blank">introduce</a> the iPhone in 2007. Before that moment, I had assumed that the ubiquitous Blackberrys and Nokias and Razors of the world were cutting-edge technology&#x2014;but that keynote was an epiphany about how buried in the past those phones actually were. You don&#x2019;t realize your Blackberry sucks until the iPhone exists. The feeling I had watching that keynote is the same feeling I had when I was six and I saw someone type on a computer word processor for the first time, and the last word on the line would magically jump to the line below when it hit the edge. Typewriters, which had seemed normal that morning, were suddenly ancient. The same thing happened when I saw the first iPod and became instantly disgusted with my horribly clunky and inefficient big booklet of CDs.</span></p> <p class="p1"><span class="s1">I had this feeling again, last month, when I test drove a Tesla Model S. I had driven to the Tesla factory that morning in what had felt like a brand new rental car, and I left the factory in the same car, now feeling like a 1982 model. I get now why Matthew Inman <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/comics/tesla_model_s" target="_blank">calls</a> his Model S a &#x201C;magical space car&#x201D;&#x2014;because that&#x2019;s how it felt. That&#x2019;s how a new, revolutionary technology always feels. Our modern world became as advanced as it is not by floating up an inevitable advancement river, but because of a collection of moments over time when a person or company has done something that makes everyone&#x2019;s jaw drop.</span></p> <p>But those world-changing moments don&#x2019;t just smoothly glide into the world: these leaps into the future usually have to <span class="s1"><em>jam </em>themselves through the canopy and then battle to keep themselves there. The past, which likes to loiter casually in our present world, hates when a piece of the future bursts onto the scene, because that exposes the past for being what it really is&#x2014;the past. So a new and disruptive technology is often met with hostility as it emerges, as the existing canopy does whatever it can to squash the potential disruptor out of existence before it can gain momentum and start to spread. The old guard knows that once a disruptor gets a foothold and starts quickly spreading its ideas, the entire game changes&#x2014;and once that balance tips, now instead of trying to squash the disruptor, everyone has to scramble </span><span class="s1">to try to <em>emulate</em> it.</span></p> <p>What Tesla is doing right now is an up-close example of how that kind of change happens.</p> <p>The idea to change the car industry started as brainwaves zipping around Elon Musk&#x2019;s head, as Christie Nicholson learned the hard way, but Musk couldn&#x2019;t do much about it on his own. To make the idea real, he had to <em>scale </em>those brainwaves up, and he did that by building Tesla. That brought a new player into the car industry, run by a collective super-brain made up of 11,000 Tesla employees who also happened to think a lot about electric cars.</p> <p>Change doesn&#x2019;t happen on a familiar landscape&#x2014;change has to construct the landscape itself. This is part of the reason the challenges Tesla has taken on are so enormous. Henry Ford didn&#x2019;t just build a car&#x2014;he built a landscape, defining what a car was. Since then, car companies have worked within Ford&#x2019;s landscape. Bringing back what Musk said about Ford&#x2014;<em>He was the kind of guy that when something was in the way, he found a way around it, he just got it done. He was really focused on what the customer needed, even when the customer didn&#x2019;t know what they needed</em>&#x2014;it&#x2019;s clear that this is exactly what Musk and Tesla are doing right now. If there aren&#x2019;t enough charging stations for long-trips, build an energy network of Superchargers. If scalability is held back by the high price of lithium-ion batteries, build a factory that doubles the world supply of them to bring the price down. Just get it done.</p> <p>But with a goal as ambitious as &#x201C;accelerating the advent of sustainable transport&#x201D; and a victory condition as far-reaching as &#x201C;half of all new cars being electric,&#x201D;<a href="#footnote-27-3667" id="note-27-3667" rel="footnote">27</a> building one great car company isn&#x2019;t enough. To bring Musk&#x2019;s original idea to the next level, Tesla would need to scale <em>itself</em>. To do that, Tesla is building a line of cars so stellar that it&#x2019;s going to change the public&#x2019;s expectations of a what a car should be, and the whole industry will have to adjust to that new expectation.</p> <p>And by solving so many EV problems for its own cars, it&#x2019;s forging the path to an EV-dominated world for all the other companies too. A company trying to rise to the top of their industry would hold their innovation secrets close&#x2014;but because Tesla&#x2019;s goal is to<em> transform</em> the industry, in 2014, Tesla made <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/blog/all-our-patent-are-belong-you" target="_blank">all of their patents</a> available to whomever wanted them.</p> <p class="p1">Other companies are critical to the mission, because Tesla&#x2019;s goal is to ramp production up to 500,000 cars, which is only around half a percent of the total cars made each year. He explained, &#x201C;The impact that Tesla will have is fairly small in and of itself. It will change people&#x2019;s perception perhaps, but it will not in and of itself change the world. But if large numbers of people are choosing to buy the Model 3, and the car companies see that there&#x2019;s no excuse left anymore because the car&#x2019;s long range and the car&#x2019;s handling and acceleration is better in every way than a gasoline car, and it&#x2019;s affordable&#x2014;and people are pretty sure this is what they want to buy&#x2014;then that&#x2019;s what will prompt car companies to invest real money into electric vehicle programs of their own, and indirectly, by spurring competition, Tesla can be the catalyst for a multi-order of magnitude shift of the entire industry towards electric.&#x201D;</p> <p>That&#x2019;s how to spread the brainwaves of a single person throughout a huge industry and the global public&#x2014;and by the time it&#x2019;s done, everyone will think a lot about electric cars.</p> <p>Maybe I&#x2019;m wrong about something, or maybe something unexpected happens&#x2014;but from what I&#x2019;ve seen, read, and talked about, it really seems like Tesla is going to fulfill its mission and change the world. It&#x2019;s going to <em>accelerate the advent of sustainable transport by bringing compelling mass market electric cars to market as soon as possible. </em>If the Model 3 ends up being as great as they say it&#x2019;s gonna be, there&#x2019;s no doubt in my mind that electric cars will be the norm far earlier than they would have been. Which will, in turn, mean that 50 years from now, the atmosphere&#x2019;s CO<sub>2</sub> level will probably be lower than it would have otherwise been, cities will be less smoggy than they would have otherwise been, global temperatures will be lower than they would have otherwise been, the sad polar bear will get to eat seals again, along with about 12 other positive effects that will legitimately affect our lives. Pretty down-the-middle definition of changing the world.</p> <p>Meanwhile, this is what Musk spends <em>two</em> days of his week on. With the rest of his time, he&#x2019;s trying to make humanity a multi-planetary species&#x2014;a goal that makes his Tesla mission seem like starting a grapefruit stand.

The sun is full of particles that have mass. Mass has gravitational potential energy. When so many particles are gathered in one place like they are in the sun, they squish together unpleasantly until they combine with each other, which is called nuclear fusion, and it&#x2019;s an intense process that releases a ton of energy. So to say it boringly, the gravitational potential energy of the sun&#x2019;s particles ignites fusion, which generates radiation energy, and that&#x2019;s the energy we receive from the sun on Earth.

General Motors actually had made a great electric car in the 90s that customers loved, called the EV1. But GM realized that if the car caught on too much, the California mandate would look like a huge success and other states might decide to do it too. Meanwhile, customers might also decide they all wanted electric cars. None of this would be ideal, considering that GM makes 10 million new cars a year, 99.9% of them run on gas, and it would suck if GM&#x2019;s entire inventory was suddenly seen as outdated. So GM and the other companies did their best <em>not </em>to sell their electric cars, to show how little the world wanted them and how big a failure the California mandate was. After using all the muscle they had to shut down the mandate (with the help of the Bush administration, whose Chief of Staff, Andy Card, was CEO of the American Automobile Manufacturers Association previously), car companies whisked the new electric vehicles they had made off the roads. GM, who had only <em>leased</em> the EV1 to customers, demanded each one returned, against the pleading wishes of their lessees, and then had all of them crushed like the mafia offing a bad apple they wanted to make disappear. EV1 lovers staged a <em>funeral</em> for the cars. Not many instances in history when a company has torn a product away from paying customers who cared so much about it they&#x2019;d read eulogies about it. The well-made documentary <a href="http://www.whokilledtheelectriccar.com/" target="_blank"><em>Who Killed the Electric Car?</em></a>, made in 2006,<em> </em>tells the whole story (the sequel, <a href="http://www.revengeoftheelectriccar.com/" target="_blank"><em>Revenge of the Electric Car</em></a>, made in 2011, tells the story of Tesla and the recent resurgence of the electric vehicle market).<a href="#note-12-3667" class="footnote-return">&#x21A9;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-12.footnote--><li id="footnote-13-3667" class="footnote"><p>Musk reportedly did not get laid that night.<a href="#note-13-3667" class="footnote-return">&#x21A9;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-13.footnote--><li id="footnote-14-3667" class="footnote"><p>Alternating current is the type of current that comes out of your home outlets and it generates power by electrons moving back and forth in a quick vibration in the wire. This is opposed to DC, or direct current, which is the more intuitive type, used with batteries, where electrons flow through a wire in a single direction (since electric cars use batteries, the battery produces direct current, which then has to be converted into alternating current through a box in the car called an inverter). Back in the 1880s, Thomas Edison, who was heavily invested in DC, engaged in a battle with George Westinghouse, who had teamed up with Nikola Tesla to push AC, over the best way to power homes. This was called The War of Currents. Tesla&#x2019;s AC won because it could travel over much larger distances without overheating&#x2014;Edison&#x2019;s way would have needed lots of small power stations so that each home was relatively close to one of them, while AC could be produced in a huge power plant and then travel far away through a grid.<a href="#note-14-3667" class="footnote-return">&#x21A9;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-14.footnote--><li id="footnote-15-3667" class="footnote"><p>Faraday, who discovered induction, was their second choice.<a href="#note-15-3667" class="footnote-return">&#x21A9;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-15.footnote--><li id="footnote-16-3667" class="footnote"><p>I cued up <a href="https://youtu.be/MmQb94EF1UY?t=29m14s" target="_blank">this video</a> to where you can hear Musk call hydrogen cars &#x201C;bullshit&#x201D; and then go on a little rant about them.<a href="#note-16-3667" class="footnote-return">&#x21A9;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-16.footnote--><li id="footnote-17-3667" class="footnote"><p>Among many reasons hydrogen cars seem inferior to EVs, here are four:</p> <p>1) Hydrogen cars seem beholden to natural gas, a fossil fuel, in order to extract the hydrogen fuel, while electric cars get cleaner over time as electricity production gets cleaner.</p> <p>2) When it comes to energy density, driving range, and cost, the best case scenario for hydrogen cells is similar to where EV batteries are now, and EV batteries will get better with time.</p> <p>3) Hydrogen is a somewhat dangerous and difficult-to-handle substance that&#x2019;s a nightmare compared to the simple wall-outlet electricity EVs use.</p> <p>4) Down the road, when the norm is to charge the car up in your garage, it&#x2019;s going to seem primitive to have to go to a station to fuel up.</p> <p>In an email exchange I had with Musk about hydrogen cars, he explained it like this:</p> <p><em>If you take electricity coming from a solar panel and charge a battery, you can get ~90% efficiency. Simple and cheap. Instead, if you use that electricity to split water, separate the hydrogen with extreme purity, pressurize it to crazy levels (or, even worse, liquefy), transfer it to a giant (even in liquid form) hydrogen storage tank in the car and then recombine it with oxygen to generate electricity, you would be lucky to get ~20% efficiency. Expensive, complex, bulky and super inefficient. It loses on every dimension, including refuel time when pack swap is factored in. </em></p> <p><em>Cost is bad for fuel cells, but that is only one of many bad dimensions. If fuel cells were in any way better than lithium batteries, they would at least be used in satellites, some of which cost over $500 million. They are not.</em></p> <p>Finally, if I wasn&#x2019;t already convinced, this highly-detailed, fairly devastating <a href="http://cleantechnica.com/2014/06/04/hydrogen-fuel-cell-vehicles-about-not-clean/" target="_blank">takedown</a> of the argument hydrogen cars left me feeling eternally puzzled about why the Japanese companies would want to go further down that road.<a href="#note-17-3667" class="footnote-return">&#x21A9;</a></p></li><!--/#footnote-17.footnote--><li id="footnote-18-3667" class="footnote"><p>When you click a footnote next to &#x201C;kWh,&#x201D; you&#x2019;re signing up to learn what a kWh is.

The unit of <em>energy </em>is the joule (which itself is the energy required to move one newton one meter). 1 watt = 1 joule/second. 1 kilowatt is 1,000 joules/second. A megawatt is 1 million joules/second, and a gigawatt is 1 billion joules/second.

When we talk about car batteries, we don&#x2019;t use joules because the numbers would be too big and inconvenient.

Most EVs charge at night and some have Time of Use (ToU) rates that encourage charging at super-off peak times. At those times, the energy production mix is very different. The base load power generation from nuclear, wind, and hydro tend to dominate at those hours. Coal plants are often at idle levels. Natural gas peaker plants are offline. Wind tends to be stronger at night. Matter of fact, if a coal plant is already at the lowest production level it can be at overnight, using power from it does not add any additional pollution or carbon production until the amount of power used from it rises to a point where the production level needs to increase. As a result, the overnight super-off peak production has a far lower carbon and pollution level than the annual averages suggest.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-283267"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283267" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283267"> http://radical-moderation.blogspot.com/ <span id="dsq-author-user-283267">TheRadicalModerate</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283267" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283267" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Do you have a cite on the &#x201C;wind is stronger at night&#x201D; assertion? That seems counter-intuitive to me, since wind is mostly driven by convection, which requires Big Bright Ball In Sky.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m also having trouble with your &#x201C;coal plants at low levels aren&#x2019;t as polluting as at max level&#x201D; statement. First, baseload power keeps on chugging through the night&#x2013;that&#x2019;s why it&#x2019;s baseload power. Second, the only way to throttle a coal plant is to burn less coal, and burning less means less heat to the boilers. I&#x2019;m trying to figure out if that means lower-temperature steam or not, but it definitely doesn&#x2019;t mean <i>higher</i>-temperature steam, which is the only way to improve actual efficiency. CO2/kWh definitely isn&#x2019;t going to be lower, and may actually be higher.</p> <p>I have a comment further down-thread on this, but there are two problems with the whole &#x201C;charge EVs at night&#x201D; idea:</p> <p>1) &#x201C;Charge EVs at night&#x201D;, when applied to fallible humans who really want to make sure they can go to work the next morning, means &#x201C;come home at about 18:00 and plug your car in before you walk through the door&#x201D;. That generates a <i>huge</i> peak that overlaps with the late-afternoon peak.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t own an EV, but if I were Tesla or GM, I&#x2019;d have a programmable charging schedule built into the charger. However, since ordinary fallible humans hardly ever RTFM, most chargers will charge as quickly as possible as soon as they&#x2019;re plugged in. And even for those who <i>do</i> RTFM, if I were them I&#x2019;d be inclined to get 20 miles into the car as quickly as possible for emergencies. Same problem.</p> <p>2) The reason that baseload power is baseload is not because it isn&#x2019;t used at night&#x2013;it&#x2019;s because it <i>is</i> used at night. It provides the minimum power that&#x2019;s used round-the-clock. If you start generating significant loads off-peak, you wind up needing at least intermediate power if not peakers in the off-peak, and they&#x2019;re expensive and inefficient.</p> <p>Now, if you have a 10 kWh Powerwall and a 60 kWh Model S, it doesn&#x2019;t take much math skill to notice that your rooftop solar doesn&#x2019;t shift the peaking charging hours very far&#x2013;certainly not enough to avoid melting the grid at 20:00 or 21:00 instead of 18:00. On the other hand, if you have rooftop solar and a 100 kWh Powerwall, that&#x2019;s another story.</p> <p>With EVs, getting from here to there is going to be challenging. That doesn&#x2019;t mean we shouldn&#x2019;t do it&#x2013;we should&#x2013;but I don&#x2019;t see how you get there without at least a smart grid.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-3" id="dsq-comment-283270"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283270" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283270"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283270">tech01xpert</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283270" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283270" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>There are a number of publications that discuss stronger wind power at night, for example: <a href="http://www.windsystemsmag.com/article/detail/355/wind-power-forecasting" rel="nofollow">http://www.windsystemsmag.com/article/detail/355/wind-power-forecasting</a></p> <p>As for coal, for many power generation plants, there is a minimum level that they can idle at, since they do not respond quickly to power fluctuation. Therefore, they typically can only idle down to 40%. Nuclear plants are 100% all the time that they are &#x201C;on&#x201D; and therefore at super off peak times, the energy mix is in many states is mostly nuclear, wind, hydro and some coal generation that is at minimum idle levels. Until the amount of EV charging + &#x201C;normal&#x201D; super off peak usage is enough to cause an up throttling of either natural gas or coal, then the amount of greenhouse gas emissions or pollution is effectively zero. The emissions from those coal plants at minimum idle levels would be emitted regardless of whether or not the EVs use that power. The ability to use that power at super-off-peak times is actually a problem within itself that EVs nicely solve.</p> <p>As for time charging, that&#x2019;s precisely what many EV&#x2019;s can do. A Tesla, for instance, can remember the time to charge at individual charging stations based on geolocation. Many other EVs have the ability to set the time to charge and some EVSE&#x2019;s also have the ability to set a timer. In many areas, there are EV specific Time of Use (ToU) rates that encourage the behavior of charging at super-off-peak times. Those rates can be as low as 4 to 6 cents per kWh, which means driving at around 2 cents per mile for energy. </p> <p>The grid is getting smarter all the time and EVs is actually part of helping solve the overall power generation equation. By soaking up super-off-peak power production, it makes more sense to build clean base load power from any number of technologies. Also, it would make sense at some point to have EVSE&#x2019;s that check in with the grid to randomize charging and control levels within the owner&#x2019;s parameters. Most people only need to charge for an hour or two at night most of the time due to the low average daily mileage (35 miles is about 12 kWh, achievable in 1.2 hours at 10kW, or under 2 hours at 7 kW) . Further, it is also possible to charge EVs from solar during the day if nighttime charging does not work out for a particular EV or location.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-4" id="dsq-comment-283436"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283436" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283436"> http://radical-moderation.blogspot.com/ <span id="dsq-author-user-283436">TheRadicalModerate</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283436" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283436" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for the reply. I understand what you&#x2019;re saying about coal now&#x2013;makes sense, as long as they need to take some baseload capacity offline during super-off-peak. The &#x201C;wind stronger at night&#x201D; thing has me puzzling over the physics, but the data you cited (and others) seems pretty definitive. Huh.</p> <p>It occurs to me that we&#x2019;re looking at two different technology trends that are somewhat antagonistic to one another:</p> <p>1) The renewables folks are agitating for a very smart grid comprised mostly of peaking plants to supplement gaps in the renewables, with almost no baseload.</p> <p>2) But an equally smart grid with lots of battery sinks to flatten the peaks could be run with more baseload and almost no peaking.</p> <p>Seems like either way, rooftop solar with batteries is a killer residential technology, while utility-scale solar is considerably more iffy. If nuclear could get its political act together, it would be a no-brainer for the baseload plus batteries strategy, but given that the public hates it so much, it&#x2019;s going to take a pretty big breakthrough pretty soon to make the baseload strategy work.</p> <p>That&#x2019;s a shame, because the big problem with a renewable-dominated mix is that it grows capacity very slowly. Even once you&#x2019;ve eliminated most of the carbon-based sources, that still tends to depress demand growth for power, which could kill some pretty interesting technologies in their infancy. As I mentioned somewhere else, the near-term one would be high-scale desalination, but I&#x2019;m sure others will crop up.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282222"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282222" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282222"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282222">Ravion</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282222" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282222" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Awesome :3 looking forward to SpaceX post</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282224"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282224" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282224"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282224">Mike</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282224" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282224" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I have some criticism, but first I&#x2019;ll say that I&#x2019;ve read 3.25 posts now from Tim, and all of them have been incredibly insightful and entertaining. I&#x2019;ve only read Part 1 of this post up to now.</p> <p>Do liberals need convincing about climate change? Then why do you approach this topic from a perspective that appeals to leftist psychology?</p> <p>Here are some basic things that liberals/socialists believe on a basic level:<br> 1. Humans are crappy<br> 2. Humans need to follow the current social authority, which always knows better<br> 3. Private property is theft</p> <p>Here are some things that conservatives believe, which you could have used instead:<br> 1. Humans, sometimes, even with our good intentions and our wonderful wisdom, make mistakes<br> 2. It&#x2019;s important to be responsible and take care of our things<br> 3. Humans aren&#x2019;t always good at taking care of things, even when they think they are</p> <p>You used all the wrong analogies. Liberals are the in-group haters, the ones who hate things that remind them of themselves; conservatives are the over-zealous in-group altruists. You mixed it up. Here&#x2019;s how:</p> <p>&#x201C;And what does a dog do who finds a cave of pulled pork? Does he pause to think cautiously about how to proceed or consider consequences for his health? No&#x2014;he eats the shit out of it. Mindlessly, at full speed.&#x201D;</p> <p>What an appealing analogy. Humans are so mindless&#x2014;like dogs. I hate them.</p> <p>&#x201C;The UN-supported Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from a bunch of different countries, came out with a report that laid out the temperature projections of a number of independent labs.&#x201D;</p> <p>Is the UN the ultimate authority for good in the world? Why should we care? How can we trust them? Is the IPCC (faceless authoritative figure in our society) trustworthy? Is this another example of the &#x2018;climagegate&#x2019; scandal?</p> <p>&#x201C;But let&#x2019;s not ostracize the skeptics. We can massage it into a statement that leaves plenty of room for doubt&#x201D;</p> <p>Ah, those silly skeptics. Skepticism is so bad (unless it&#x2019;s trendy).Let&#x2019;s be condescending to them. Don&#x2019;t you stupid conservatives understand that the scientists are the authority here?</p> <p>Here are the words of Elon Musk (which I agree with):</p> <p>Alison van Diggelen: &#x201C;Do you have a message for the climate change skeptics and the big oil people?&#x201D;</p> <p>Elon Musk: &#x201C;Well, as far as climate change skeptics&#x2026;I believe in the scientific method and one should have a healthy skepticism of things in general&#x2026;if you pursue things from a scientific standpoint, you always look at things probabilistically and not definitively&#x2026;so a lot of times if someone is a skeptic in the science community, what they&#x2019;re saying is that they&#x2019;re they&#x2019;re not sure that it&#x2019;s 100% certain that this is the case. But that&#x2019;s not the point. The point is, to look at it from the other side. To say: What&#x2019;s the percentage chance that this could be catastrophic for some meaningful percentage of earth&#x2019;s population? Is it greater than 1%? Is it even 1%?

As demand for gas lowers, the price for gas will also lower. When few people buy gasoline, are they just going to lock up all the oil and roll over and die? Basically I&#x2019;m wondering about the fundamental cost of producing a barrel of oil (20 years from now), because that&#x2019;s the price that EV&#x2019;s have to beat.</p> <p>But actually, if eV&#x2019;s achieve even 30% market penetration, public opinion may shift so much that a carbon tax will basically stifle what&#x2019;s left of the gasoline era in the countries that have that many electric cars. </p> <p>We&#x2019;ll see.

Like who the fuck short of a half-crazed sociopath knowingly sets out to sell an unambiguously poisonous, cumulatively neurotoxic heavy metal aerosol right up until the year 2000 when finally banned? Turns out to be the same guys that tell us 403ppm CO2 is no problem. Some things are legitimately political, whether or not to put kids at risk to perpetuate the profits of an outmoded industry practice instead of reinvesting decisively in energy and transportation options that don&#x2019;t isn&#x2019;t one of them.</p> <p>Two issues I do have with this article &#x2013; and by extension issues I have with Musk&#x2019;s line of reasoning is that the issues faced by the fossil fuel industry are identical to the issues faced by big auto. Both have heavy investment of capital and IP in what they do (and would rather carry on milking it than suffer the expense and upheaval of change), both could technically diversify and reinvest in renewable energy production and EVs respectively. On balance I think they are both fucked because &#x2013; like the immensely wealthy steam railroad barons before them who were financially best placed to dominate automobile production to just carry on serving their passengers transportation needs but failed to adapt, these are organisations cultured around the purpose of trying to profit from a particular technology. It&#x2019;s not just the executives and board members, thousands of highly trained staff &#x2013; from oil rig and refinery workers to engine and transmission specialists for example have no qualifications of relevance to work in a solar panel or EV company. I suspect the investment markets and customer markets will simply move on leaving more assets like NUMMI stranded and up for grabs. While that is the truth of it IMO, I am equally confident that the best way to play it is what Musk usually does &#x2013; which is to play nice &#x2013; open source patents and beg so-called competitors to compete including in Norway to an oil industry convention &#x2013; and not what he did the other day on CNBC which is to acknowledge the fact that fossil fuels are in a life or death struggle. </p> <p>The other thing is about Carbon Tax. Logically you cannot have an effective zero sum carbon tax that is not an economic burden regardless &#x2013; it would just create general inflation. What you can do is defer capital gains taxation on a one way street of getting out of fossil fuel investments (not government interference but government getting out of the way) thereby reducing the friction of moving vast sums of trapped wealth back into the global economy for the rapid growth of a replacement energy infrastructure thereby creating a historic boom of global economic activity &#x2013; and with it put an end to the rationale for vested entrenchment that gives rise to genocidal climate change denial.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282300"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282300" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282300"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282300">thes</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282300" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282300" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#x201C;Do liberals need convincing about climate change?

The answer to the first question (do liberals need convincing) of course is no, but this is all heading towards a larger question &#x2014; what is the better strategy?<br> 1) Convincing conservatives that climate science is accurate, and therefore they should consider an EV.<br> 2) Convincing liberals that since climate science is accurate, they should consider an EV.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t think the first is likely to succeed. Cognitive biases are real &#x2013; it&#x2019;s hard to change people&#x2019;s minds once they&#x2019;re made up, and it&#x2019;s doubly hard to do that on a topic that has become a Red vs Blue political issue. With polarization being what it is, the best mileage (heh) in terms of promoting something like EVs seems like getting people who are already on board with climate science to take the leap and buy one. Including some paragraphs about climate change being real probably does more good for the small group of apolitical rationalists than it does for convincing partisans on an issue where the battle lines have already been drawn.</p> <p>If I wanted to convince conservatives to buy a Tesla, I&#x2019;d skip the environmental arguments entirely and just focus on the brand&#x2019;s areas of superior performance over standard cars and the cost savings over the expected life of the vehicle. Talking about climate/environmental impact just signals Blue Team politics and might drive Red Team members away. A study found this effect actually occurring with CFL bulb advertising strategies.

This can create a perception that there is little room left for would-be innovators. Second, the activation energy required to make a difference &#x2013; to reach a level of success that actually enters the world stage &#x2013; may seem unrealistically unsurmountable. </p> <p>You, however, make a clear compelling case that it is in fact possible to &#x201C;spread the brainwaves of a single person throughout an industry.&#x201D; And it is belief in exactly this possibility &#x2013; the knowledge that success is within the envelope of possible outcomes &#x2013; that leads one to act on raging ambition. </p> <p>And &#x201C;raging ambition,&#x201D; as you put it, is the ingredient that launches the world forward. This brings us back to you. Your post here (which is the best post yet, of a long string of great posts) inspires raging ambition in its clarity of focus, and your reach is wide enough, that I expect it quite likely that you, yourself, are changing the world in a not-insignificant way.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282974"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282974" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282974"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282974">Jerry Bradbury</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282974" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282974" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What he said.

Black things get hotter when they are left under the sun because they like to keep photons for a long while inside them until they have little energy left and you can&#x2019;t see them, all the energy they drain from the photons becomes heat.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282231"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282231" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282231"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282231">kon</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282231" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282231" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Excellent article Tim, I am sharing your articles since quite a while now <img src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"></p> <p>one addition to this post: the car company Renault is building EVs since the late 90s and recently launched a fleet of some zero emission vehicles. esspecialy the Tweezy is getting quite a common site here in Germany</p> <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Z.E" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renault_Z.E</a>.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282232"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282232" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282232"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282232">harun</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282232" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282232" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>some people like CEOs of GM or oil companies need a high five<br> in their face<br> with a chair</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282306"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282306" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282306"> http://www.obama.com <span id="dsq-author-user-282306">Barack Obama</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282306" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282306" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This chair</p> <p><a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/images/ny/NYWINchair1b.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.roadsideamerica.com/attract/images/ny/NYWINchair1b.jpg</a></p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282233"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282233" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282233"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282233">sacocheio</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282233" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282233" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Economy 101 question: what about the electricity price?

I&#x2019;ll clarify. Raw oil has to arrive at your cars fuel tank as refined gasoline. Let&#x2019;s assume conventional crude. The drill requires electricity. The oil well pump requires electricity. The pipeline requires electricity. The refinery requires alot of electricty. The gas pump at your gas station requires electricity. Sure, a barrel of oil contains a notional 1700 kWh of energy potential, but only about half of the barrel is turned into gasoline&#x2026;.so about 850 KWh worth of energy potential. Since two thirds of that energy potential gets wasted as heat in a typical ICE, only about 300 KWH worth of that barrel of oil turns the wheels of your car&#x2026;how many KWh were used to pump, refine, ship and dispense the gasoline?<br> Long story short, with electric car, no need for electricity to pump, refine, ship and dispense the gasoline. The electricity used in the refining process alone will power the e car. So your straw man argument is moot. No need to use electricty to refine gasoline, use electricity to power the e car. Cheers.

In an electric car, that is about enough to drive 10-15 miles even after transmission and charging/battery losses.</p> <p>As for the OP question, solar is putting a cap on the price of electricity. Sure, the price is likely to go up if you are currently using coal as your primary electricity source. However, natural gas prices are very low, nuclear is mostly already paid for, and solar is close to grid parity.

This is IMO far from neglible. One of the reasons is the fact that electricity on offshore fields is produced in low efficiency compact generators using non refined fuels, and they need to do a lot of processing on the fields to separate gas and water from the oil, pump water back down to keep the pressure up, etc. Tar sands must be heated to release the oil. Since this is the most expensive oil to produce, it will be the first to be abandoned when we use less oil.</p> <p>Refining use a lot of energy a s well. Not necessarily electricity. The oil must be boiled and fractionally distilled, and then they must remove sulfur, produce additions to adjust the octane level, etc.</p> <p>If you spent all the energy used to produce gasoline from well to tank, either directly or to make electricity in a high efficiency generator, you could _probably_ run an electric car far longer than you could drive on the produced gasoline. Exact numbers have proven to be very difficult to obtain, because the oil companies don&#x2019;t like to share them.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282304"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282304" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282304"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282304">Andrew Karmy</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282304" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282304" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>One line of thinking on this is that most Electric Vehicles will be charging over night for 2-6 hours.

Not you Tim &#x2014; you&#x2019;re fantastic. And of course not you Elon &#x2014; I love you. But these goddam oil/car/energy companies. </p> <p>After reading this post, I got in the elevator and saw a late teen holding a fresh cigarette ready to go. I&#x2019;ve seen this kid smoking outside my building almost every time I enter and exit. He must smoke in excess of 8 cigarettes a day. From the few times we&#x2019;ve exchanged hellos, I could tell he&#x2019;s a sweet kid. But as I was looking at him in the elevator for those few moments going down, I saw standing next to me an innocent victim of a well-known threat that could have been very easily avoided. The tobacco companies KNEW. They FRICKEN KNEW. And yet they hired low-integrity scientists to spread lies throughout the media that threatened the lives of millions, and even the generations that followed! This kids life is being cut short because a few tobacco companies wanted to make more money and deliberately spread lies so deep within the public&#x2019;s consciousness that society today is still ignorant of the dangers of cigarettes. We all know this. It&#x2019;s history for god&#x2019;s sake, but I never really was impacted by it as much as I was after reading this post and seeing the kid in the elevator. </p> <p>And now I think, the SAME. EXACT. THING is happening with climate change, and America and humanity at large is falling into the same trap. What?? The same tobacco-danger-denying scientists are being hired as climate change deniers? Many runner ups for the American presidency refuse to accept that climate change is real and/or caused by humans. Its almost too ridiculous to be true, and yet it is. But this time its worse because the people who are going to be affected by this climate change are not only the ignorant who by into the propaganda, not only the educated who are aware of the propaganda yet are too outnumbered politically to prevent it, but also the generations of kids in the future who will suffer the consequences without ever having a say in it. </p> <p>But as this post elucidated, there is definitely hope. There is most certainly hope. Mankind has tremendous resources, both material and cognitive, and could easily solve this problem effectively over the course of two decades at most, if it wasn&#x2019;t for those goddam oil/car/energy companies. If it wasn&#x2019;t for those goddam oil/car/energy companies, the public would be convinced by the evidence for climate change, as are the majority of scientists. Having heard the evidence uncontaminated by random false claims and having recognized the scientific consensus behind that evidence, they would easily vote for policies and politicians and presidents that would solve these problems within decades. This is not what is happening in large part because of these goddam companies, like what occurred with the tobacco industry. But why should we just sit back and let the leaders of those companies prevail? If this is a propaganda war, then lets fight it. Not just Elon Musk. Not just Tim Urban. But you. You the people. The Wait but Whyers. The educated few. If you didn&#x2019;t know about these issues until now, well, now you know. Congratulations, you have just joined our army. We&#x2019;re not fighting with guns. Where not fighting with fists. No, we are fighting with words and we are fighting with knowledge. Heavily armed with the tools that 21st century social media presents, each wait but whyer can spread this knowledge to at least two more, and each of those two more, and so on. In today&#x2019;s world, one person, if they care enough and if they go about it with creativity and wit, can have an unimaginably large impact. </p> <p>So how can you help? Well sharing this post is a start. Having conversations with others about these topics and stimulating their interest is another step. Being proactive in politics and political discussions is another. These little things really do help. I&#x2019;m going to try emailing some youtube celebrities who happen to have a serious influence on their subscribers, and ask them if they can maybe mention climate change even for a second. Many of them are incredibly unaware of how much power they yield over their viewers, especially the younger celebrities over their younger viewers. One comment about climate change can seed this very important idea in the minds of millions who never gave it a thought.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t just read this comment and forget about it. If you got this far that means you&#x2019;re interested. Elon Musk is doing his part. Tim Urban is doing his part.

I doubt that Musk would spend $5B (even if a lot of that cost is heavily subsidized) to build a factory without having the upstream supply chain secured, but I&#x2019;ve read plenty of articles suggesting that rare earth elements are the limiting reagent on the scalability of everything discussed in Tim&#x2019;s article and everything Tesla&#x2019;s doing.</p> <p>Maybe the answer is that supplies of the raw materials for batteries haven&#x2019;t been explored as fully as, say, oil, because the demand for them hasn&#x2019;t been strong enough to date.

Last post&#x2019;s cliffhanger was: What&#x2019;s Musk&#x2019;s secret sauce?, a driving question used a lot in mysteries, and how much you know about the topic of Procrastination and how you know Musk personally, I won&#x2019;t accept an answer other than you. And as a good writer instead of showing off in the reveal the answer to the driving question out of nowhere you start foreshadowing: with terms like Raging Ambition used to describe why technology takes leaps forward and explaining how brain waves inside Musk were transformed into the physical world, not an answer but definitely hints.</p> <p>B) I recently watched House Of Cards Season 1 and it&#x2019;s interesting how energy resources are only used by politicans to achieve their ends, not really caring about the long-term stuff. For example, Claire works for an initiative meant to support clean water, while accepting support from a fracking corporation, a process that poisons water. This Clean Water vs. Fracking theme also happens in Peter Russo&#x2019;s campaign. And at the end of the season Nuclear Emergy comes into play in the protagonist&#x2019;s story. I&#x2019;m not U.S.American so I really don&#x2019;t know much about U.S. Politics, but, from watching House Of Cards, it seems it doesn&#x2019;t matter to politicans on a either party, they support anything that helps them gain power, that and with the greed of corporations may be why the U.S. government may not be that helpful on promoting renewables.

Fire is combustion but not explosion. </p> <p>It&#x2019;s technically a &#x201C;golf car&#x201D; but most people get that wrong. </p> <p>Many (perhaps most) people don&#x2019;t have a place to park overnight with access to charging. It works well if you have a garage and adequate house wiring. Even at that, it&#x2019;s an issue when you get a second EV. Not many homes can support multiple 50A circuits in concurrent use. The first problem will be solved given enough time. The second one could be solved easily if Tesla put out a variation of their HPWC with multiple cables and load balancing that could either lower the amperage per vehicle or charge them in sequence.</p> <p>The previous point would be practical because you both understated and overstated charging times. For home use, you stated time based on a mostly depleted battery, while most of the time, it will be a matter of making up for that 37 miles. That will take closer to 3 hours at most on a typical day, making it very practical to charge multiple vehicles overnight. </p> <p>The understated part has to do with road trips. It&#x2019;s realistic to leave San Francisco with a 100% charge, stop at Harris Ranch for lunch, and make it to your destination. That&#x2019;s fine if you are going to a hotel that has charging capability. If not, then making another brief stop of perhaps 15 minutes, or until your spouse comes out of the convenience store, will give you enough charge for your remaining trip, local driving at your destination, and plenty of power to get to a supercharger on your way back. But at that point you are starting out needing a full charge. If you stop for a meal at that charge, you will still end up needing another big charge on the road, which might mean sitting at the charging station for as much as 40-60 minutes, assuming you didn&#x2019;t get a complete charge at your stop for a meal. So it will all come down to planning. If you can charge at your destination and not tie up your time doing so, then your scenario is pretty much on target. If you can&#x2019;t do that or need to start your trip at a time that makes a meal stop work better between charging stations, then you might have another 40 minutes beyond what I already mentioned, or some hungry kids complaining if you bypass a place to eat early on..</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282927"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282927" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282927"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282927">Tipsy</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282927" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282927" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It&#x2019;s technically a &#x201C;oh fuck off&#x201D;.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-3" id="dsq-comment-283073"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283073" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283073"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283073">Haggy</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283073" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283073" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thank you for your eloquent and mature comment.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282284"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282284" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282284"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282284">Dan R Sandberg</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282284" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282284" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Great article &#x2014; two points I&#x2019;d like to nitpick:</p> <p>1) Opening up the patents isn&#x2019;t necessarily altruism. It can be great business move if he&#x2019;s planning on monetizing the super charging network he&#x2019;s built. He gets other car companies to use his batteries, and power-trains and eventually they use his super-charging infrastructure as well. That would make for a huge future business even if they&#x2019;re not selling any cars. </p> <p>2) The hero-worship (and Musk IS a hero to me) goes too far with the single-man pushing through a new technology against the wishes of entrenched competitors theory. Big steps happen in technology when a bunch of smaller requirements are satisfied by the evolution of technology. </p> <p>In the case of electric cars, laptops/tablets/etc got common enough that Li-Ion cell prices dropped sufficiently to make a high-performance electric car feasible. Tesla&#x2019;s success is built on the back of dozens of years of Li-Ion investment and development. It&#x2019;s kind of like crediting Wilbur and Orville with the airplane &#x2014; it was being worked on by lots of people around the world, and if they hadn&#x2019;t done it someone else would&#x2019;ve within a few years.

One minor nitpick: the highest safety rating that NHTSA gives out is 5 stars and they slapped Tesla&#x2019;s hand when that blog post claiming 5.4 stars appeared. Brave to the Tesla team (because it got lots of press and highlighted just how safe the car is), but it probably doesn&#x2019;t add anything to your article by repeating it because it gives the haters something to refute. Just go with 5 stars which is good enough for the point you were making. That said, I totally agreed with Tesla&#x2019;s reasoning there. Certainly the 5 star Tesla Model S is safer than the 5 star Volvo S60 based on the internal VSS scores returned to the manufacturers, but NHTSA doesn&#x2019;t recognize that other than to provide the numbers as possible areas to improve.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282291"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282291" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282291"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282291">Dane Harrington</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282291" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282291" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Anyone feel like climate change is like the White Walkers in Game of Thrones?

I have read just about all your posts within the span of about 6 months including this one, and you are doing a huge favor with your writing. You have a great style to your work that leaves me wanting more. Except for today, I&#x2019;m quite done with this article and need to get to some work of my own. I have about 40 Wikipedia tabs open and have been working thru this piece since early this morning I need to stop! Once again your work is great and I look forward to all your future articles especially when they include freaky looking animals.<br> Here are some of my thoughts regarding Tim&#x2019;s work.</p> <p>1. The pictures are great, the portait of Kangxi Emperor, the Q1,2,3,4 info graph, the animated engines, even the horribly wonderful stick figure drawings(they make me mad as an artist because of there impact/enjoyment ratio to skill level is ridiculously inbalanced, but mainly because i also enjoy them *I hope you struggled with them.)The visuals in your articles are a big reason i enjoy your writing so as far as I&#x2019;m concerned the more the merrier.</p> <p>2. I knew that I had a foggy idea on Global warming and the impact electric cars will have on the equation. Now I&#x2019;m dead certain I know almost nothing and I&#x2019;m going to have dig a great deal deeper. But at least after reading this I have just scratched the surface which is a big step forward so thank you Tim.</p> <p>3. I want an electric car, and I will probably have a used one at some point when the price point becomes cheaper then a standard automobile and not before.</p> <p>4. Who will be the people in my close network tier 1 and 2 friends/family to adopt a EV first and why. My mom is the most likely her price range is about 20k-30k for a new or slightly used vehicle. She cares about its comfort and safety first. Then its mpg second. and then the way it looks and brand loyalty coming in at #3 carbon footprint is a very distant #4 but still there somewhat akin to the dealership telling her that every sale we donate 100 bucks to charity. Which is just fine because safety comfort mpg and price are the very things that are being pushed for the EV! About about a third of the male friends/family have a very strong and almost romantic appreciation for the internal combustion engine and manual transmission. Performance, The sound and feel of the engine the familiarity and love of working on something with so much history. So how do you get soul in an EV car i think you need a story, and you need an appeal to the man/or woman who wants to work on there vehicle also a way to offer more control some sort of manual shifter analog. yet being out of my depth in many ways in the conversation when it comes to being a &#x201C;gear head&#x201D;. We are not just limiting the scope of the conversation to just innovations in the automobile we are talking about human progress and survival of the species which there is a much wider tree to branch out from and that gives me a trunk to stand on. The last demographic which is the majority is purely affordability. 3k-12k for a vehicle that does really well on gas or is really cheap in order to make up for the lower mpg (*btw this includes people that are concerned with global warming). So until they can get a used EV in that price range, it doesn&#x2019;t mater how strong everything else principles be damned they are gonna bite the bullet and leave their carbon footprint.<br> My take away from this is basically the cheaper the better. For everyone else Its gonna take time to warmup to.</p> <p>5. Money is a great metric for evaluating the majority of peoples actions, and actions speak louder then words.</p> <p>6. Your readers are awesome, I love reading comments. I hardly ever post on stuff like this because I hate speaking my mind on something I don&#x2019;t have a strong grasp on. Writing this is more of a way to work out my own thoughts and put a bow tie on this article so I can get some work done. </p> <p>7. I&#x2019;m trying to make this post as short as possible so I will stop here.<br> 8.

You explored the substituction effect (EV for gas cars) but you never questioned if maybe the dissolution of the energy requirement of transportation could be an alternative, or why we believe we need to own a car. We have a wonderful atheltic body, built to run, hunt, climb and swim, yet 90% of us now (at least in the developed countries) sits in front of a monitor for 9 hours a day and then sits on car to go back and sit in front of a PC/TV. Is a society built like this a good society? I personally believe that not, is not. Does Tesla wants to change this vision? No, they still think that every home should have a 2-ton car to move their asses around. In this way, Tesla is not revolutionizing ANYTHING. A true paradigm shift would be the switch to a local-living society powered by what I think is the most beatiful and perfectly designed transportation mean ever: the bycicle. I don&#x2019;t own and will (hopefullly) never own a car: bycicle, train, buses, car sharing and short term rental are more than adequate for me. Live near your workplace. You have to sacrifice some freedom, and you have to organize you world around these constriction, but is perfectly doable. We car-less people are like the early-EV adopter: we live with the shortcoming, but we are convinced of our choice. And we are getting more numerous by the day,thanks to the sharing economy. This alone would provide I think an even bigger reduction in greenhouses gases that the switch to electric cars, that still needs huge highways, parking lots, garage, tunnels, bridges and so on, all requiring fuel and energy to build. Snow plower in winter to make the suburbs road driveable for tiny, low-floored cars. The energetic, health, climate and infrastructural impact of a society convinced that owning and maintinaing 1 or 2 cars per household is immense. It is probably worth another post &#x1F609; But you should have questioned the car existence itself. Is a marketing lie even bigger than the one propagating about tobacco and EV cars.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282312"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282312" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282312"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282312">CMCNestT .</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282312" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282312" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Utopian Leftist that want to destroy modernity and take us back to the Middle Ages are kissing cousins of ISIS.</p> <p>You will never succeed democratically and if you succeed with violence it will be short lived.</p> <p>Tesla is revolutionizing society.

This is not the condition of the human being and of our body.<br> Electric cars will be great for health and environmental problems, but the title of tTim Urban&#x2019;s post is: TESLA will change the world. I&#x2019;m debating that Tesla will not change our world: we still will moving around in 2-ton cars, maybe with only one people in it. Yes, it will be electrical, but the fundamental &#x201C;problem&#x201D; (people commuting for hours) will not be adressed by TESLA. I&#x2019;m just saying that a true change for the world will be driving less, not driving differently.<br> There is one piece of data truly relevant from Urban&#x2019;s post: the average american drives 12&#x2019;000 miles /year. I&#x2019;m the only one here that thinks that this is insane and not what a society should aim to? I merely propose to try to reduce this distance. Even with automatic car moving around at 30 mph in average (including start and stop), this still means 400 hours a year &#x201C;wasted&#x201D; SITTING in a car moving around. I find this amount insane.<br> I&#x2019;m not fighting technology: I simply don&#x2019;t think that owning a car will be the future. The future will be smart automated car coming to your home when you need it: only a few will own a car.

But still, it will change an average of 20 mpg_eq consumption in 40-50 mpg (up until the grid will be 100% renewable). Tesla is still selling the &#x201C;american dream&#x201D;: house in the suburbs, 2 cars (electric) in the driveway. That&#x2019;s why is building a supercharger network: it doesn&#x2019;t want that people change their habits! He wants that driving a Tesla should be identical (for range, status, etc) to driving a fuel car. So in this way, he is replacing the underlying technology (huge accomplishment, one for which we should be grateful) but he is really not changing people habits and people lives. I still thinks that the biggest contribution in cutting private transportation emissions (which is the basic goal, as stated by Tim) will be completely new form of mobility (and anti-mobility, like home-office, virtual conference meeting). Those will truly change the world and reduce emissions.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even depth-4" id="dsq-comment-282323"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282323" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282323"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282323">C30</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282323" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282323" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I agree with almost all your points, but the sad truth is that US cities are so stupidly and inefficiently built that Americans will continue to need some kind of personal transportation for the foreseeable future.

John Cook is a left wing political activist who runs the pro AGW website skepticalscience.com. The source is definitely biased, but that&#x2019;s not all, if you read the study, there is absolutely no data to justify the 97% claim, Cook never actually asks the climate scientists he just reads their work and then classifies them without their input. Soooooooo much room for the abuse of subjectivity, here are some comments by some of the scientists he cites after reading his study:</p> <p>&#x201C;Cook survey included 10 of my 122 eligible papers. 5/10 were rated incorrectly. 4/5 were rated as endorse rather than neutral.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x2014;Dr. Richard Tol</p> <p>&#x201C;Cook et al. (2013) is based on a strawman argument . . .&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x2014;Dr. Nicola Scafet</p> <p>&#x201C;Nope . . . it is not an accurate representation.&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x2014;Dr. Nir Shaviv</p> <p>&#x201C;That is not an accurate representation of my paper . . .&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x2014;Dr. Craig Idso</p> <p>This number is not reliable, decent research would have revealed this.</p> <p>Now personally I have no idea if AGW is true. But NO climate models, not one, have successfully predicted long-term trends and thus they cannot be used to draw conclusions. Additionally, climate scientists get funding largely due to concerns over AGW, creating a conflict of interests. Tim mentions none of this, he sticks precisely with the leftist narrative complete with Kochsteria and nasty comparisons to the Tobacco Industry.</p> <p>And then there&#x2019;s this from The Procrastination Matrix:</p> <p>&#x201C;For every Steve Jobs or John Lennon or Hillary Clinton or J.K. Rowling or anyone else whose talents have enhanced our lives&#x201D;</p> <p>&#x266B;One of these things &#x266A; is not like the others&#x266B;</p> <p>Nope, Tim has no agenda, he is not trying to influence the 2016 election at all.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282335"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282335" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282335"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282335">Korakys</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282335" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282335" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#x2019;ve always assumed 100% percent of climate scientists think climate change is anthropogenic on account of if they didn&#x2019;t then clearly they are no longer fit to be climate scientists any more, they would never get a contrary paper to pass a peer review and could never work as one again (unless they take the oil money).</p> <p>97%, it makes me scratch my head.

You have done well in terms of providing clarity to the car industry issues. Depth and presentation was very well done. You have great talent at framing issues in very clear and simple manner.<br> Some issues I woud like to point out to further enhance the scope of debate:</p> <p>1) Personal transportation &#x2013; cars are a good niche for &#x2018;short-range mobility of the individual&#x201D;. Personal electric car will become a mainstay for this niche. First with our classic asphalt roads and perhaps in the future with propulsion assistance roads &#x2013; maglev/electric drive assist or some sort where the road network provides partial/most of needed energy &#x2013; like it does for trains.<br> However &#x2013; efficient public transportation systems &#x2013; fast,efficient trains &#x2013; both intra-city and long distance based upon ever efficient propulsion/less polluting and greater network efficiency are the most logical solution for meeting the transportation needs in the most energy efficient and least polluting manner. </p> <p>So while EVs are great for immediate substitution. The greater game changer would be efficient rapid mass transport systems. Unfortunately setting up of such networks &#x2013; even if we have the technology requires vast capital resouces &#x2013; which may not be feasible atleast for a few decades until the current breaking down economic system is reordered and a new inflection point in human development begins. </p> <p>Tesla and Musk are providing a key solution and behavioural change in this transition period and they must be lauded for that.</p> <p>2) In terms of energy efficiency, EVs will greatly help in increasing energy efficiency. However again their role is great for short term &#x2013; few decades and unfortunately the impact will be incremental rather than of order of magnitude.</p> <p>What I am hopeful about is the technological push towards better batteries/charging that Tesla and EV revolution will cause. </p> <p>The long term energy question for human species will be a product of two forces:</p> <p> a) Better Nuclear Technologies &#x2013; this is a great long-game. The key to making the jump from Energy Scarce Civilization to Limitless Energy Civilization. And of course Limitless energy leads of Limitless material Resouces ( tons of stuff in space to mine). Once this stage is achieved &#x2013; all energy generation/resouce extraction can be shifted off-Eath and Earth&#x2019;s fragile ecosystem preserved.<br> However this step is fraught with our social/political/psychological issues &#x2013; a potential Barrier. All such technologies can be weaponized for MAD and the resulting competitive political quagmire makes this a pipedream until a possible radical outlook change.</p> <p>The barrier here is not science or tech. If the world magically united in a cooperative purpose tonight then in a couple of decades we can repurpose our nuclear/military-industrial compex knowhow into achieving this and overcoming the tech barriers. </p> <p>b) GREAT DECENTRALIZATION &#x2013; Past 10,000 years in human history has been an experiment in greater and greater centralization from tribes to villages,towns,cities,states and now towards global. However complexity/power capture and elephant like inefficiencies creep in. We are now reaching the precipice of possibility of reversing that trend towards more sustainable decentralization and distributed network structures. Maximization of local resources in a sustainable manner &#x2013; example local energy renewable resources harvest and consumed locally with surplus added to the grid. Local 3D printing &#x2013; local manufacturing etc.</p> <p>In such possibilities the energy storage/charging/distribution tech impact of EV would be potentially great. Hats off to Musk for being enabler for that.</p> <p>3) Anthropomorphic Global Warming however is not as clear cut defined as your put it. Climate change is obvious &#x2013; earth has a complex history of alternating warming and cooling cycles at all time scales &#x2013; from few century long ones to those lasting few millions of years. The temperature changes in a vast/complex system spanning timescales millions of years long is too great a scope for our limited data and modeling capacity</p> <p>In any way the restriction of debate about unsustainable impact of Human activity into a global warming/climate change is the greatest CON Job in the history of Power. By putting focus on this grey area &#x2013; a complete white wash of the REAL impact of human insanity has been done for short term profits &#x2013;<br> the oceans are dying &#x2013; fisheries collapse, sensitive rich ecosystems &#x2013; forests,reefs are being destroyed. Mining has horrendous ecological impacts, big agriculture with monocultural crops and GMOs has badly damaged crop variety/soil health putting food baskets in danger and the greatest of these &#x2013; the rapacious impact on water resources.</p> <p>Humans will have long made the entire delicate ecosystem unsustainable long before whatever temperature rising/cooling cycle impact takes place unless the present exploitative paradigm is reversed.</p> <p>This requires psychological and socio-economic reorganization where infinite mindless GDP growth, short-term profit maximization and relentless consumption equating status are not the dominant paradigms</p> <p>Still Every Action is like a drop in the ocean. Individually small but together they make the ocean and Tesla is a great step in that direction.

He knows Tesla isn&#x2019;t going to save the world, but it could be a catalyst or at least nudge the world toward salvation. He might not succeed, even at putting people on a better path, but I&#x2019;d say he&#x2019;s about a zillion times more likely to have a positive effect than someone who thinks the kind of religious conversion you&#x2019;re talking about is going to do it.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-3" id="dsq-comment-282563"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282563" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282563"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282563">cotpoe</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282563" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282563" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>If you consider that being &#x201C;human&#x201D; means short-sighted exploitation of the planet and the worth of a human is defined by the &#x201C;stuff&#x201D; they own then you have a very narrow, limited view of what it means to be human, my friend. It is funny you applaud Musk while defending this concept of &#x201C;being human&#x201D; is when he himself is strongly opposed to that and trying to change this with his energy/space projects. </p> <p>Musk is doing great work. I was just cautioning against over-hyping possibility of EV. It is great for short-term but largely an incremental substitution. The technologies it generates will be the real impact here. </p> <p>It is funny when someone equates socio-economic reorganization as religion considering you are the one talking about &#x201C;nudge towards world &#x2018;salvation&#x201D;. If you read history then over periods of centuries &#x2013; a major socio-economic reorganization is common. Old systems give way to new. Nothing new or religious about it. </p> <p>The point I was presenting is that such a change in mindset and consequent change in how we approach our problems for holistic,longer-term sustainable view would be the crucial impact of the work Tesla is doing. We are already in an accelerating sci/tech epoch &#x2013; the problems we have are largely organizational.</p> <p>The systemic change I mentioned will not happen overnight or one person &#x2013; the metaphor of individual action as drops in an ocean which however small compose the ocean. I lauded Musk and Tesla on generating new electricity storage/transport tech as well as the major role his actions are playing to influence mindset changes towards more sustainable systems in the future. These I think will be the predominant impact of his work with EVs.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282354"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282354" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282354"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282354">Thomas</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282354" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282354" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Congratulation for this article,<br> and for a lot of your blog ! </p> <p> But for global warming wich became climate change, why ?

However on the climate change portion the math seems to be off. If the sun is 99.8% of the mass of our solar system and it is 1.3 million x bigger than our planet&#x2026;It seems no other factors really matter other than the change in the temp of the sun. Also during the mini ice age right before the industrial revolution we saw sun spot activity go very low. This leads me to believe the sun is the most important variable in climate change arguments. Also when you see a high correlation between two variables like co2 and temp statistics tells us we are more than likely measuring two effects rather than a cause and an effect. </p> <p>Love your work.

This mechanism explains the correlation with the reasoning being that more CO2 causes an increase in temperature. They are not &#x201C;two effects&#x201D;. The former causes the latter. There is no serious despite about that among serious scientists.</p> <p>As for the Sun, I fail to see how that&#x2019;s relevant, because it&#x2019;s not changed appreciably since 1800. It will burn out eventually &#x2013; but this is part of the star cycle, which is orders of magnitude slower than what we&#x2019;re dealing with here: fast human activity changes. Let&#x2019;s say the Sun had X units of hydrogen to fuse in 1800. Today, the Sun has X units of hydrogen (to any reasonable number of significant figures).</p> <p>Plus, the Sun&#x2019;s radiation disperses and is absorbed and reflected through millions of miles before reaching the Earth: sure, it&#x2019;s incredibly big when you compare its mass and diameter, but due to the inverse square law such a low proportion of the Sun&#x2019;s light reaches Earth that you&#x2019;d need a significant decrease in hydrogen fusion by the Sun to affect the Earth&#x2019;s energy cycle more than burning fossil fuels and deforestation does.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-3" id="dsq-comment-282360"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282360" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282360"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282360">Eric O&#x2019;Reilly</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282360" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282360" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I appreciate your points.

Now imagine a hose running into the bathtub, pumping in a small amount of additional water. This represents extra carbon added to the atmosphere by humans.

If you put concrete next to water in an experiment and measured temp changes and retained heat you would find the surface of concrete heats up but the core does not. While water will heat the entire volume. As you remove the energy source the surface of the concrete will cool quickly while the water will take longer. So yes mercury is closer but heating the core of rock and then that rock retaining heat is difficult due to the reflective nature of solids.

As you mentioned, a lot of the big car companies are pouring massive funds into both battery and fuel cell technologies, and I wanted to expand upon the battery vs fuel cell debate, and why hydrogen fuel cell vehicles are indeed &#x201C;bullshit&#x201D;:</p> <p>1) Obviously, providing a source of hydrogen is a major challenge. Right now, it&#x2019;s mostly made from reforming natural gas (as you mentioned), which is a highly valuable fuel on its own. One approach that doesn&#x2019;t require fossil fuels is to complete the inverse of fuel cell chemistry (water &#x2013;&gt;hydrogen and oxygen) powered by solar energy&#x2013;either directly through a photoelectrochemical water-splitting device (the DOE is funding such research) or using solar energy to power a separate water electrolyzer. However, these processes are NOT efficient. Ultimately, one is still taking solar energy, converting it to electrical energy and subsequently chemical energy, and then on top of that, generating gases which must then be separated and stored (which also requires energy). </p> <p>2) Hydrogen has to be stored in the car. This has been cited as a safety concern, but the greatest barrier is that hydrogen isn&#x2019;t an energy-dense fuel and it must be compressed or otherwise specially stored (such as adsorbed in various materials) in order to not need a ridiculously large fuel tank. Which requires. . . more energy!</p> <p>3) A hydrogen fueling infrastructure must be in place, which will be very costly to create. California is investing in a hydrogen-fueling network, but I read a hydrogen fueling station is about five times more expensive to build than a battery recharging station. In addition, hydrogen is much more difficult to transport place to place than electricity, since we already have an electrical grid in place.</p> <p>Steven Chu also cites the fact that fuel cell technology must also be further developed, making the total number of huge problems equal to four. In summary, Chu&#x2019;s quote (possibly the best quote ever) about the four-problem challenge: &#x201C;If you need four miracles, that&#x2019;s unlikely: saints only need three miracles&#x201D; (If a Nobel Laureate/former Secretary of Energy has this opinion, perhaps we should take note.)</p> <p>So, why then is anyone bothering with hydrogen fuel cell vehicles???</p> <p>Apparently, we can thank California, which is the only state whose emission requirements can supersede the federal regulations. However, other states can adopt CA&#x2019;s requirements, which currently includes Connecticut, Maryland, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont. </p> <p>But what is the ZEV mandate, and why is this favoring hydrogen fuel cell vehicles over battery vehicles (or at least appear to put them on the same playing level)? Here&#x2019;s a pretty great article, which I will summarize below: <a href="http://blog.caranddriver.com/what-replaces-gasoline-hydrogen-may-be-winning-the-zero-emissions-battle/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.caranddriver.com/what-replaces-gasoline-hydrogen-may-be-winning-the-zero-emissions-battle/</a></p> <p>Fist, the ZEV mandate, in a nutshell: &#x201C;California manages the ZEV mandate using its own version of Monopoly money known as ZEV credits. Automakers earn different types of credits for the different types of<br> automobiles they sell in the state, including ZEVs, plug-ins, hybrids, and low-emission internal-combustion cars. Through 2017, the largest automakers&#x2014;Fiat Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Honda, Nissan, and Toyota&#x2014;must earn ZEV credits equal to 3 percent of their Cali&#xAD;fornia sales, with requirements for plug-ins, hybrids, and low-emission vehicles equal to another 11 percent of sales. ZEV credits become real money when CARB starts its annual accounting of credits and manufacturer obligations. To make up for a shortfall or to cash in on an abundance of credits, carmakers can buy or sell them from and to each<br> other. If they fail to come up with the necessary credits, they face a $5000 penalty for every one they&#x2019;re short.&#x201D;</p> <p>So how are fuel cell vehicles favored with the ZEV mandate?</p> <p>1. &#x201C;In 2018, a vehicle&#x2019;s electric range becomes the only factor in determining the number of credits it earns. . . The current crop of 75-mile BEVs will earn about one to one and a half credits under the 2018<br> rules, but adding range to that type of vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive. Doubling the energy capacity of a lithium-ion battery requires twice as many expensive cells and additional equipment to support them. Meanwhile, carrying more hydrogen in an FCV only means a larger carbon-fiber fuel tank, which adds minimal additional cost. FCVs should easily earn the maximum of four credits for 350 miles of range.&#x201D;</p> <p>2. &#x201C;Further boosting hydrogen technol&#xAD;ogy&#x2019;s fortunes are changes to the rules regarding credits originating from FCVs. Starting in 2018, they can be transferred among any of the eight states that are partaking in the ZEV requirement. There is no equivalent provision for BEVs.

You have the sun which for all practical purposes is the source of all of the heat on the planet. The sun rotates and has hotter and cooler spots that are at any point in time directing energy at our very small planet (this is a good thing by the way that we are so small relative to the sun). That energy hitting our planet is the big number. And we all know a small change in a big number is still a big number. Then we have the electromagnetic field which is a really awesome energy filter. It too fluctuates. Without it we would be like mars and have no atmosphere at all. And Mars is further away from that glowing hot fusion reaction in the center of our solar system &#x2026; just think if the EM field around Earth wasn&#x2019;t there. Now the energy that makes it through that EM field is filtered futher by the hydrogen and helium in our upper atmosphere and the ozone layer and the ionsphere. Then finally the to troposphere which is only about 6-7 miles high. Now the heat number in the equation is still the big number in the equation. We finally make it down to where us humans hang out (insert stick figure here) and in all of our infinite wisdom we think a gas that is .04% &#x2026; that&#x2019;s .0004 of the atmosphere has the ability to retain enough heat energy to raise the temp of the PLANET &#x2026;. literally a carbon atom would have to have a much larger mass and still float to accomplish what climate change suggests. So I am going to stick with the big numbers as math tells me focus on the elephant in the room. The sun and the EM field are the big numbers. I would advise everyone to focus on the fluctuations of the large numbers as opposed to buying into the argument the tiniest of numbers matters. And for those of you that think anything is constant in the universe and that the radiation that hits our planet is constant here is a link. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum</a><br> As I have stated in posts below, if we have a way to generate electricity where we capture 100% of the heat from the joule release and 100% of the carbon emission then I would love to see that and all of us drive electric cars. Coal ash is a real problem though (kinda like nuclear waste). And the storage of energy is the other big issue. Nothing stores joule for joule the amount of energy as a barrel of oil for the price. No doubt though lithium ion batteries are making a much larger dent in that number but they are still far away from getting there. And for the solar power arrays they are still heat islands similar to concrete. They retain way more heat than a forest does. Nobody wants to talk about the heat islands that cities and solar panels create. For some reason we want to talk about a trace gas in the atmosphere and frankly do imaginary math.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt depth-6" id="dsq-comment-282479"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282479" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282479"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282479">sturle</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282479" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282479" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>0.04% is still a pretty thick layer when it is distrbuted over 6-7 miles. The mass is irrelevant. Try putting a black surface and a window in direct sunlight. See what heats up the most. The window will of course not heat up, because it is transparent to the suns rays. Just like O2 and N2. The black surface will heat up, because it absorbs the sunlight. This is exactly what CO2 does for infrared radiation (heat). If you have a crystal clear pool 6-7 miles deep, and add 0.04% black ink to it, you will not be able to see much of the bottom. This is our atmosphere to infrared radiation, which is emitted from the earth. We need some taint to the atmosphere. If there was no CO2 in the atmosphere, the average temperature on Earth would be -17 &#xB0;C. As you would understand if you did the right math, there isn&#x2019;t much room for change in this taint if we want to keep the temperature stable. On Venus it went very wrong. The surface there is warmer than on Mercury due to runaway greenhouse effect. </p> <p>It is not so much about the radiation hitting the earth on the way in, as this has relatively little infrared. Much of the incoming infrared radiation is absorbed high up in the ozone layer, which is the reason why the higher stratosphere is warmer than the tropopause below it. From there most of it gets radiated back out into space. It is about the infrared radiation which gets trapped in the troposphere on the way *out*. This is basic knowledge.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even depth-6" id="dsq-comment-282481"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282481" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282481"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282481">Eric O&#x2019;Reilly</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282481" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282481" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think you should try that experiment.

Even the blackest coffee is quite transparent. CO2 is perfectly black to the thermal infrared wavelengths where the earth radiates its heat back out to space. Put 0.4 milliliter of potassium permanganate in the bottle instead, and place it in front of a strong lamp next to a bottle with clear water. Measure the temperature in both bottles after a few hours. If the clear water is perfectly clean (e.g. no dissolved CO2), the temperature will increase very little because the light will pass straight through it. The bottle containing potassium permanganate will be quite warm because much of the light is absorbed.</p> <p>This is exactly the same mechanism as when the Ozone layer absorbs UV radiation. You don&#x2019;t deny that as well, do you? The concentration of O3 in the ozone layer is less than 0.001%. This is enough to absorb 97-99% of the radiation from about 200 nm to 315 nm wavelength. It absorbs UV radiation (and much IR radiation from the sun as well), gets warm and radiate the energy back to space.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even depth-6" id="dsq-comment-282542"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282542" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282542"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282542">wow</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282542" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282542" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Wow!

I thoroughly enjoyed it and I wish there was a way to blast this out to the entire world and convince everybody to read it. I have two minor quibbles though that I hope you&#x2019;ll get a chance to address.</p> <p>1) You said at the top &#x201C;This is a highly politicized issue, but this post has no political agenda&#x201D;. That&#x2019;s an admirable goal and I believe you meant it, but your post definitely serves a political agenda, which is to contribute to the perception that anyone who disagrees with the idea that global warming is an imminent threat must be either ignorant, stupid, or dishonest. Many informed, intelligent, and honest people don&#x2019;t buy into the threat because A) The climate is an incredibly complex system, and by their own admission climate scientists aren&#x2019;t close to fully understanding it, and B) They have a deep mistrust of scientific alarmism, which has a pretty awful track record going all the way back to Malthus. Painting all climate skeptics with the same brush most definitely plays into the hands of a powerful political agenda.</p> <p>2) You gloss over the fact that Tesla&#x2019;s business model relies heavily on the U.S Federal $7,500 EV subsidy. That&#x2019;s a problem because A) There&#x2019;s no guarantee they&#x2019;ll be able to procure similar subsidies in other countries, hell, there&#x2019;s no guarantee that the current U.S subsidy will make it past the next President. And B) This amounts to a direct transfer of wealth from all U.S taxpayers to Tesla and to Tesla&#x2019;s wealthy shareholders. That&#x2019;s a simple moral problem.</p> <p>Otherwise, fantastic job. The depth of your research always impresses me but you&#x2019;ve out-done yourself here.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282517"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282517" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282517"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282517">Stephen Wilson</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282517" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282517" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>1)Climate skepticism only exists because of a political agenda.<br> 2) We are all taxed globally indirectly by climate change, what you call subsidy i call an insignificant contribution to the ACTUAL cost of warming the planet for global citizens.. ie. humanity</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-3" id="dsq-comment-282534"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282534" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282534"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282534">Barry</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282534" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282534" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Whether what you say is true or not, and I do agree with some of it, it doesn&#x2019;t address my main concerns.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-4" id="dsq-comment-282556"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282556" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282556"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282556">Sergio</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282556" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282556" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Barry &#x2013; I certainly share your concerns, and appreciate you bringing them up in a thoughtful and constructive way following such a great and well researched article by Tim. To your issues with the popular alarmism, I also am a bit mystified by the almost irrational exuberance of many intellectuals to advocate such drastic courses of action based on a science that, while promising, still seems unable to offer reliable and accurate predictions about the climate even a decade out. I&#x2019;m on board with the notion that climate change is happening, and am open to the notion that fossil fuel combustion is a contributing culprit &#x2013; seems intuitive &#x2013; but to take society level action through the use of serious and far reaching tools of government force and coercion based on this infant science seems batsh*t crazy to me. </p> <p>To your second issue &#x2013; while I loathe subsidies, I don&#x2019;t particularly take issue with Tesla receiving this particular wealth distribution since I learned of the subsidies paid to oil, gas and coal industries that each individually dwarf the renewable energy credits. If the price of existing fossil fuels are being artificially reduced through wealth transfers, then it stands to reason that renewables ought to be extended the same courtesy to even the playing field a little. Either advocate the elimination of all subsidies and wealth transfers (my preference and philosophy) or accept them all. </p> <p>Other than that, I too found Tim&#x2019;s article to be a fantastic and engrossing read (read: massive time sink!).</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-282561"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282561" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282561"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282561">Mind Bridge</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282561" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282561" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&gt; seems unable to offer reliable and accurate predictions about the climate even a decade out</p> <p>The IPCC 1990 projections have been almost 100% correct.

First, while CO2 and temperature are correlated with each other, ice core data shows that CO2 rise FOLLOWS temperature rise, and does not cause it. Correlation does not equal causation. There are other factors that affect the climate much more than the miniscule amount (0.04%) of CO2 in the atmosphere. That big nuclear fusion reactor in the sky probably has some effect. </p> <p>Second, it is a myth that &#x201C;renewable&#x201D; energy can just clean up the grid real quick to lower the CO2 footprint of EVs. Even the engineers at Google have evaluated renewable energy and concluded &#x201C;Trying to combat climate change exclusively with today&#x2019;s renewable energy technologies simply won&#x2019;t work.&#x201D; An EV will remain a fossil-fuel powered car until we massively scale up nuclear energy&#x2013;its as simple as that.</p> <p>EV&#x2019;s are a great option for local commuting, but they will always be inferior at driving long distances due to the energy density of the batteries vs the energy density of liquid hydrocarbon fuels.

Most of the time in a day you aren&#x2019;t driving anyway. Remember your car will be fully charged every morning, and you can drive at least 400 km before you have to charge it. If you haven&#x2019;t passed any fast chargers in those 400 m, I&#x2019;ll be surprised. Use the opportunity to take a piss, get a cup of coffee and a snack before you drive on, because 400 km is a very long stretch.</p> <p>b) True, not everyone want to drop $100k on a car. It is all about your priorities. And remember to calculate savings on gas, oil change, service, etc.</p> <p>c) I&#x2019;ve taken holidays far from any superchargers. No problem. Quick charge when shopping, or eating, get a full charge overnight at the hotel, etc. In Europe 22kW AC chargers are plentiful, and those will deliver 100 km extra range per hour of charging. On the motorways between major cities, which is the rapid route in most cases, there will usually be a supercharger.</p> <p>And the owners of electric cars disagree with you. 1 in 5 cars sold in Norway is electric. Only 9% of all respondents in a large Norwegian study on electric car owners said they would consider an ICE the next time they went shopping for a new car. Over 90% wouldn&#x2019;t even consider it, while about 40% of ICE car owners would consider buying electric next time. Electric car owners are very happy with their cars, and won&#x2019;t switch, while the ICE owners are less happy with their cars and consider switching to an electric. It usually comes down to b).

For example in replacing all the gas cars ever made with batteries that can go 1000 miles on a charge. It is very expensive to extract from seawater though.

The only problem is that right now, debating it is kind of like arguing over what hobbies people will have when they colonize Mars. </p> <p>A lot of what we rely on is fancy untested theories and imagination. And if history teaches us one thing about the fancy untested theories that people come up with, it&#x2019;s that they are a great source of punchlines a few hundred years later. </p> <p>Everything from the earth being the center of the universe to aether to smoking being healthy seemed like a really reasonable and logical idea to a lot of people at one time.</p> <p>A couple of things I noticed about the effects of temperature change above:</p> <p>1) The difference between 18,000 years ago and today was 5 degrees. It was also 18,000 years. I get impatient waiting for an ice cube to melt. I would imagine that watching half a mile of ice to melt would blow my mind.</p> <p>2) The difference between 100m years ago and now was 6 &#x2013; 10 degrees &#x2013; and all of the continents. I live in a place that used to be a seabed. That&#x2019;s because the water moved. And/or it&#x2019;s because the place I live moved. With the current progression of the continents, Los Angeles will eventually be north of San Francisco. And it&#x2019;s not because the general emptiness of the culture will make it lighter so it floats on top of the sea like a too-cool-for-anything island.</p> <p>These comparisons can give us some ideas but they are not definitive.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t at all believe that everything is fine and nothing can go wrong. It&#x2019;s more like we&#x2019;re collectively taking our entire paycheck every 2 weeks and using it to buy lottery tickets. Things could work out really well or it could be the dumbest thing ever but right now we have no idea and people who talk about how they have the magic numbers or no one wins the lottery ever are both wrong. That&#x2019;s scary, but we have to live with certain risks like climate change and giant asteroids wiping us out.</p> <p>So why do we have to live the risks with fossil fuels anyways? For a long time I didn&#x2019;t really know, then I read The Rational Optimist (great book by the way). It points out that before we have fossil fuels, we used mammals for a lot of our power. And not just by chaining up horses and similar animals. What humans do to other animals and inanimate objects, they also do to other humans. And that&#x2019;s how slavery became a major power source throughout much of human history.</p> <p>At any other time in history, you probably had a better chance of being the power source than the power consumer. Climate change sounds like it could be pretty bad. But I know our history also includes a lot of really awful things.</p> <p>Imagine that one day everyone on your street went crazy and started murdering each other so they could steal their neighbor&#x2019;s shit. Most of human history was, in fact, just that. </p> <p>Until a couple of hundred years ago when so much awesome shit started raining down on us out of the sky that people in some areas decided it was a lot more useful to wait for the next train instead of hiding near a road to do a horse-jacking, or sit in one place and collect the iPhones that were just appearing out of nowhere instead of killing their friends to take their rotary phones.</p> <p>Cheap, easy-to-use energy has done wonders to make us less dickish and also create cool new things in our lives. Yes it does come with a lot of risks. But there is no time or place in history that I would rather be.</p> <p>One of the more concrete threats is running out of energy sources. Even that is an unknown (people have been predicting the end of oil since a few years after its discovery). But it seems a lot more linear. I don&#x2019;t doubt that the cost of our current energy platform is rising and this will cause problems.</p> <p>I really do hope things get better. Even without new inventions, I would like to see a lot more nuclear power. Developing cheaper energy sources would be really awesome because it would mean the party of human civilization that the last 200 years have been has only reached 9pm instead of 1am and there might be an even bigger party the next day if we create super-intelligent computers or populate other planets.</p> <p>It seems like Elon Musk has a good chance of being at the center of all of that, and possibly the successor to this guy: <a href="http://www.quora.com/Why-is-Norman-Borlaug-known-as-The-Man-Who-Saved-A-Billion-Lives" rel="nofollow">http://www.quora.com/Why-is-Norman-Borlaug-known-as-The-Man-Who-Saved-A-Billion-Lives</a>. There&#x2019;s some scary shit out there, but all in all I&#x2019;m pretty excited about what could happen.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282488"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282488" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282488"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282488">Adam</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282488" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282488" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#x201C;That&#x2019;s scary, but we have to live with certain risks like climate change and giant asteroids wiping us out.&#x201D; &#x2013; No, we don&#x2019;t. We have to live with the incredibly minute risk of a giant asteroid wiping us out, at least in the near future, because we have no technology to deal with it.</p> <p>We don&#x2019;t have to live with the problem of climate change &#x2013; even if we didn&#x2019;t want to reduce our energy usage, we know exactly how solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biofuel and even nuclear power can generate electricity. We do not have to live with this risk.</p> <p>Also, for every example of science being wrong early on you can point at, I&#x2019;m sure there are many examples of cases where science was right early on. The first thing that came to mind for me was evolution: while Lamarckism was pretty flawed and Darwinism has been tweaked over the last century, ever since 1850 scientists have been pretty much right with the general concept. Animals have changed over time as a result of slow, continual adaptations to best fit their ecosystem: that&#x2019;s the gist, and that&#x2019;s been known for well over a century. Now, there were and are people who fought against evolution, because it conflicted with some kind of agenda they had: with the case of evolution, we&#x2019;re usually talking about religion and by religion, I mean &#x201C;Christianity&#x201D;. (Although, to be fair, Lamarck was a Catholic and the Catholic Church didn&#x2019;t object to evolution until a while after the theory was proposed, when they realised evolution claimed humans evolved over time, which conflicts with the Bible.)</p> <p>In a similar scenario, there are people today who fight against the theory of global warming with an agenda: companies who financially profit from oil/coal/natural gas usage. But scientific consensus has been around since the 1970s, following the first proposal for the theory in the 1890s and the first convincing evidence for fossil fuels having the potential to damage the environment in the 1950s. Science isn&#x2019;t perfect, but it holds the best answers we currently have: that&#x2019;s the point of it. And science is currently saying &#x201C;climate change is a big deal&#x201D;. Maybe it&#x2019;s wrong, but I&#x2019;d rather be safe than sorry.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-3" id="dsq-comment-282552"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282552" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282552"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282552">Sergio</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282552" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282552" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>While Darwin was right, your reasoning is a little flawed. Evolution as a theory was a great guess when Darwin first proposed it, but the real punch and thrust of that theory has come from the numerous predictions it made that were subsequently tested and verified as accurate. Evolution stands up as a theory because it has consistently, since day 1, been so great as a predictive guide to biologists, among others. </p> <p>What drives me nuts about the &#x201C;settled science of climate change&#x201D; is that to this lay person, it&#x2019;s the only &#x201C;settled science&#x201D; that can&#x2019;t seem to make a consistent set of predictions upon which we can follow up with and test or observe in the environment. If we go back to the first IPCC Report and evaluate its predictions against actual results so far, it&#x2019;s wildly off base. </p> <p>I get that this is a hugely complex and chaotic system of variables that scientists are grappling with. Cool. I get it. But my disconnect comes when I hear arguments that demand we massively curtail our way of life &#x2013; very likely having serious and significant ramifications for the poorest of even the wealthiest nations on the planet &#x2013; all because the above &#x201C;settled science&#x201D; that everyone agrees on, but can&#x2019;t actually make useful and reliable predictions with &#x201C;yet&#x201D; &#x2013; says so. </p> <p>Sounds like an example of the flawed precautionary principle or Pascal&#x2019;s Wager in action&#x2026; my 2 cents now firmly thrown in&#x2026; bring on the EV revolution, solar panels on my roof and an AI overlord butler to read me a bedtime story.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282864"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282864" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282864"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282864">jeffhre</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282864" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282864" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>One day we will know for certain, if the word of 90% of scientists still seems too opaque?</p> <p>Musk once said, the threat of climate change is like we are running a massive worldwide experiment &#x2013; on the only planet we have.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282473"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282473" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282473"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282473">MV</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282473" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282473" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Please make the spreading bullshit image into a tee.

In the far future, like in 100 years, it is beliveable to use nothing but electricity which is produced by solar and wind, but meawhile everybody speaks about changing to green energy (at least here in Europe), the amount of burned fossil fuel and emissioned CO2 rises paralell with the green energy production (because of balancing the green energies, and back-up use of gas power plants in case of no wind and sun), and the share of nuclear is decreasing.</p> <p>I understand the role of the power plants, but I have to say, that if somebody wants to save our world, he has to say nuclear and green energy simultaneously, like building a system in which they are complete, not face against eachother.</p> <p>So all, what I would like to ask that do you left that out on purpose or by accident?</p> <p>thanks</p> <p>Arnold</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282497"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282497" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282497"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282497">SeeRexx</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282497" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282497" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Because only ONE Accident creates no man&#x2019;s lands for THOUSAND YEARS.Not mentionning genetic malformations and cancers&#x2026;<br> It&#x2019;s the most anti ecological self-destructing technology invented by man, followed by fracking.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-3" id="dsq-comment-282695"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282695" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282695"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282695">TGFH</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282695" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282695" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Okay, you clarly don&#x2019;t now shit about nuclear power plants nor decays and the effects of radiation on the human body.

It can be at 2070 or 2080, but it&#x2019;s a bit unbeliavable for me. The most RES-friendly and rich countries like Germany, Denmark and UK are optimistic (in my opinion, or at least realistic), and they say, that around 80% will be the share of RES just in the electricity production. Not to mention heat and transportation. So I guess it&#x2019;s a bit silly to suppose, that before 2070 or 2080 all countries on the earth can be independent from all form of fossil fuel.

Green NGOs are fighting hard against nuclear and keep telling people, that nuclear is against the RES and prevent the move towards clean energy, but this is just not true. They can complete eachother, if you manage well your energy system. And yes, they are expensive (as the RES are expensive as well), but the clean energy has its price. And I can&#x2019;t really get the downsides, as a nuclear energy engineer. New constructions are much safer than the old ones, it&#x2019;s like everybody would be stressed to get on a plane, because the old ones were not safe. A bit different, because old NPPs are still among us (fortunately not the oldest ones anymore), but that&#x2019;s why we should to build new generation plants.</p> <p>Even IEA (if i remember well) says, that if we wanna keep the temperature raise under 2&#xB0;C, we should build twice as NPPs as we have now.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-4" id="dsq-comment-282706"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282706" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282706"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282706">Rikaishi Rikashi</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282706" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282706" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Subsidies can generally only bootstrap an industry, advance it a few years or give it a competitive edge but cannot change the fundamentals, as shown by the nuclear industry in america which apparently is 100% subsidized but still cannot attract investment, and of course fossil fuels which benefit from huge direct subsidies and unpriced external costs yet are still losing ground to renewables.</p> <p>When renewables lose all their subsidies, as has happened with small-scale solar in Australia, it usually just flat-lines the industry&#x2019;s growth for a year or two before it goes right back to the same course it was plotting when the subsidies applied.</p> <p>Subsidies should be training wheels which come off as an industry matures, but this is not how it has ever worked for energy industries.

Meanwhile we emmit a vast amount of CO2. I also read those posts and I&#x2019;m also a bit sceptic, if the AI will be good for us as a mankind or not, but it isn&#x2019;t belonging here. It is also possible, that we are gonna invent the AI just over 50 years from now, and still that, are we gonna use the fossils and emmit CO2 as we did since forever?<br> In my comment, I was talking about the short- and mid-term future, while we are not able to storage such amount of energy from daylight to night. Not a sinlge solar panel (I mean PV cell) can produce electricity at night, when our electricity consumption is about 2/3 of the consumption at daylight. (I&#x2019;m not sure what do you mean &#x201C;sufficient amount of energy&#x201D;) And without the storage technology we have to produce the energy by burning lignite, coal and gas.<br> So it is a VERY big advantage of the nuke plants, that they can produce electricity at any time without CO2 emission. And to prevent or at least slow down the climate change, we have to start to work on it just now, not in 10-20-30 years, when a new technology MIGHT BE avaliable (for storage). And I really don&#x2019;t agree with the huge downsides, the old nuclear technology is also pretty safe (we got 3 big accindents over 15000 years of operating reactors, 2 of them clearly was the fault of the technology or the operators (RBMK- Chernobyl, TMI) while one of them was the result of an enormous earthquake, and cunami, which killed like 20000 people in Japan. And, all of these were the technology of the 1960s. The new designs are at least 10x safer. So I can&#x2019;t agree with you, my opinion is, that we should incerease the amount of electricity produced by nuclear power plant paralell with the solar and wind energy so get rid of the dirty fossil-fuel plants, till we invent some acceptable and cheap strage-technology (till like 2060).</p> <p>But ofc it is just my opinion. <img src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"> We can argue on that.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-4" id="dsq-comment-283500"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283500" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283500"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283500">Tor_</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283500" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283500" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Sorry for the late answer&#x2026;</p> <p>You obviously know a fair bit about nuclear reactors.

All we do now is building solar and wind power plants, which can&#x2019;t supply energy when we need it, and when there is no wind and no solar, we have to produce the electricity with lignite-, hard coal- and gas-combustion power plants, and all-in-all, we emmit more CO2, than before..

On the other hand, if you had perfect control of load, you could construct an entire grid out of baseload&#x2013;but the perfect control would likely be expensive.

First, its power output was tiny&#x2013;a single-digit number of megawatts. Second, it didn&#x2019;t actually breed U-233 from thorium; it just demonstrated the back-end of the U-233 fuel cycle, i.e. that you could scrub the fission products out of the molten salt to keep the proper neutron economy. An important experiment, to be sure, but not even close to ready for prime time.</p> <p>Things you&#x2019;d need to do to get something like LFTR commercialized:</p> <p>1) Vastly more metallurgical work. MSRE found a couple of big problems and fixed them, but that&#x2019;s no guarantee that all problems are solved for a plant with a multi-decade useful life.</p> <p>2) You have to have the salt chemistry completely nailed.</p> <p>3) You have to have the industrial plant dealing with the salt chemistry reduced to the proper scale, engineered for foolproof safety, and capable of being installed on-site with the LFTR. This means that fission products and transuranics have to be extracted and disposed of when necessary, thorium added as needed, U-233 extracted as needed, and the salt generally reconditioned for continuous use. This is pretty much a mini-reprocessing plant inside your power plant, sitting next to some population center. An accident, an explosion, or even a bad leak could wind up being as dirty as an LWR meltdown.</p> <p>4), Safety, safety, safety. Some of that is engineering, but a large fraction of it is operational experience. You need thousands of operator-years of experience in pilot plants before you roll this puppy out into the real world.</p> <p>5) Oh yeah&#x2013;deal with the proliferation risk. LFTR proponents tend to wave away this problem because the U-233 fuel cycle is so nasty to reprocess, <i>but if you&#x2019;re going to control it for commercial use, you&#x2019;ve invented most of the tech necessary to safely reprocess</i>. Hauling bomb-grade fissionables out of a commercial power plant would be unfortunate.</p> <p>Don&#x2019;t get me wrong: I think something like LFTR will be necessary if we can&#x2019;t run the economy on renewables (and, at this point, I don&#x2019;t think we can) and if none of the fusion development efforts pan out. There are a couple of companies with commercialization efforts underway, and both India and China are doing research. This is all good.</p> <p>Just don&#x2019;t expect anything in the next twenty years.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282492"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282492" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282492"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282492">Andreas L&#xF8;ve Selvik</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282492" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282492" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Is there a kindle version?</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282500"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282500" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282500"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282500">Marcus</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282500" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282500" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Why is there this major push to charge your car at home? </p> <p>I get that it&#x2019;s convenient, but it&#x2019;s not like we fill up our cars with gasoline when they&#x2019;re parked at home, so I don&#x2019;t see the need to have to do so with an EV. </p> <p>As other have mentioned, if you live in an apartment or condo, there&#x2019;s no way to charge your car.

Think were around 15% EV&#x2019;s now or so. Ive not seen a single gas station of any kind providing charging. Main reason is most probably because its not a regulated market. I can charge at home for cheap, so i wont buy expensive power at the gas station and hang around for hours waiting for the car to fill up.<br> Norway have companies building chargers primarly for the smallers EV&#x2019;s (leaf, golf, i3 and such) which cost money to charge on, but why use that when i can charge at home while sleeping ?</p> <p>So all in all i think your last sentence might be correct somehow.

Half of America covered under a wall of ice seems really shitty to me, and that has been the case more often than not throughout history. I remember some NASA scientist expressing a similar opinion, and being ridiculed into obscurity for not towing the thought police party line. Trying to preserve the climate the way it was on $ARBITRARY_DATE is Really Really Important(tm) and anybody with a differing opinion hates puppies, and Jesus.</p> <p>Part of the problem is that our perspective is really narrow and limited. I love my forest just like it is, with all the little flowers everywhere, and all the happy trees, and not a stump in sight. My forest is what happens like 50-60 years after you stop cutting down every last tree, and it reaches an advanced stage of recovery. I like my forest just like it is, but in another 50-60 years, it will be completely different. Ironically, the only way to ensure that it looks like it does now in 60 years is to go tear it all up today, so it can recover back to the same point in the future.</p> <p>The same thing is very much true for the climate. No matter what snapshot you take of what point in history, it was different, and it will be different in the future whether we do anything or not. We&#x2019;ve liberated a lot of carbon from the ground, but we&#x2019;ve also put a serious dent in forest and prairie fires. What is the real balance in the end? Is it really positive or negative for our species? Nobody really knows, but lots of people are convinced they do.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282540"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282540" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282540"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282540">NVU</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282540" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282540" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is a thoughtful and interesting comment.

It&#x2019;s solved one way or another, fully ouside anything Tesla<br> motors or anyone else does. It makes zero sense to spend any more effort on it now. Seriously.</p> <p>But we can at least examine the posting on it&#x2019;s own merits&#x2026; and that&#x2019;s perfectly cool.</p> <p>But something must be done away with from the outset: &#x201C;Burning fossil<br> fuels makes everything shitty&#x201D;. Cleaver&#x2026; but not really correct.</p> <p>Easy to show.</p> <p>Do this: Google, type &#x201C;Dubai&#x201D;, click &#x201C;Images&#x201D;. I&#x2019;m serious. Do it now.</p> <p>Why are you still here? Go&#x2026; do it now. I&#x2019;m dead serious. I can wait.</p> <p>Welcome back. This grew from the sands. A &#x201C;lifeless&#x201D; wasteland, or<br> something close enough. This is not shitty. At all. And it all<br> essentially came from burning fossil fuels. And this is no silly<br> stunt. It&#x2019;s profoundly true in almost every literal conceivable way.<br> So clearly, not everything is shitty. The impossible becomes possible.</p> <p>In fact&#x2026; there is *much more* that we can say: Human existence as we<br> know it (or anything remotely like it), profoundly, profoundly,<br> profoundly (that&#x2019;s three &#x201C;profoundlys&#x201D;), absolutely relies on it.<br> Tesla, SpaceX, the interwebs, waitbutwhy&#x2026; all of this, and so much<br> more, absolutely rely on it. We are FAR shittier if we don&#x2019;t&#x2026; to the<br> point of insane levels of misery and chaos. Stupifying levels of misery<br> and chaos. You never seen so much.</p> <p>So the truth is rather more balanced: &#x201C;Burning fossil fuels makes lots of things damned amazing, and some things shitty&#x201D;. </p> <p>This puts it in a far more familiar and realistic realm very much in<br> tune with our experience, which is that nothing is all bad or good, and<br> you take the good with the bad. Time honored ideas. Raise you hand if<br> you think that balanced views are a bad idea.</p> <p>Tim gets huge credit for discovering (as so, so few do), that AGW is<br> really NOT about CO2 warming, but rather most of it is theory about<br> water in the atmosphere, so it makes very little sense to be all happy<br> about knowing about CO2, when most of warming is (supposed) to come from<br> moisture and water vapor&#x2026; which is an area that very, very few people<br> know much at all about. Just a handful really&#x2026; and the absolute<br> experts on it will often be heard to say things like &#x201C;well, we don&#x2019;t<br> really know a lot about how this works&#x201D;. </p> <p>So when Tim says that the theory of vapor as positive feeback is &#x201C;largely<br> accepted&#x201D;, well, that&#x2019;s true&#x2026; rather in the same way that we believe<br> all sorts of things we know little about&#x2026; like God, zoning law, and<br> food expiration dates. Accepted by whom? Certainly not by people that<br> understand it comprehensively&#x2026; because no such people exist. You will<br> notice Tim didn&#x2019;t say &#x201C;proven&#x201D; or &#x201C;tested&#x201D; or even &#x201C;understood&#x201D;. He<br> just said &#x201C;accepted&#x201D;&#x2026; so he gets bonus points for being truly<br> accurate, but loses them again by flying past *the big issue* in AGW,<br> leaving the casual reader to believe that it has been addressed in some<br> significant way. </p> <p>Re: fossil fuels and saying goodbye to them &#x201C;because they&#x2019;ll either be gone or too expensive.&#x201D;</p> <p>Well, we won&#x2019;t run out, ever (well, until either we or the planet are<br> gone). Understanding this requires a solid understanding of economics<br> and utilization. But, literally, neither can happen. Certainly, we<br> will move away from them at SOME point&#x2026; but it won&#x2019;t be because they<br> are gone. When oil gets a LITTLE more expensive, we change our<br> behavior&#x2026; and the price goes down again. And this little dance will<br> happen&#x2026; well&#x2026; forever. We see this repeated in essentially every<br> non-renewable resource. And the renewable ones too. Irrespective of<br> the wild growth of human population. The places where costs for<br> something go up uncontrollably is usually where public policy distorts<br> markets.</p> <p>The true price will remain about the same but the price we pay is<br> affected mostly by policy/war, not use or its true availability.</p> <p>The price from oil, in real terms, continually went down all through the<br> 20th century, even though we used more and more of it, until the Arab<br> oil embargo in the early 70&#x2019;s.</p> <p>See what I mean?</p> <p>Anyway, always a pleasure to read, Tim!</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282578"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282578" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282578"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282578">v43</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282578" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282578" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>WARNING: this comment ^ is ridden with half truths and tries to imposed a biased view leveraging on a few rational standpoints.</p> <p>I concur that fossil fuels are the real source of our progress and welfare nowadays, but that does not excuse the fact that they are a big environmental issue.

Going to lower and lower efficient forms of energy (like horses), would actually increase our environmental impact in lots of ways.

Back at the dawn of the motor car, New York and other major cities used horses&#x2026; and the streets ran thick with feces and urine&#x2026; and the decaying bodies of abandoned animals rotting in the heat made for a serious environmental problem and biohazard.

But then why the car is? Just because of the stored energy in fossil fuels. We shifted our energy needs from the ecosystem to the fossils. That&#x2019;s not an infinite source. I wouldn&#x2019;t know why you said in your first comment that fossil fuels will never end, because you did not give a reason for that.<br> I assume that fossil fuels are going to become more and more scarce during this century, and that they will be more and more substituted by sustainable sources (or maybe I should called those sources &#x201C;alternative&#x201D;, since &#x201C;sustainable&#x201D; implies a bias).<br> But, in the eventuality that fusion power doesn&#x2019;t work out, it won&#x2019;t be possible to substitute coal and oil and gas, especially if the population keeps growing. Then we&#x2019;ll have to face the music. Our current lifestyle obviously is NOT sustainable by the sole ecosystem and nuclear fission power, without fossil fuels. But not even the 18th century lifestyle is sustainable! We couldn&#x2019;t forage 7 billion horses and fill the atmosphere with methane. The conclusion is that there&#x2019;s a given number of people who can live in this planet off the environment, without fossil fuels, for a particular degree of technological development. With our current technology, that number is far lower than 7 billion. That&#x2019;s the point! So.. since we&#x2019;re have already overgrown the capacity of this planet, all thanks to a depletable resource, wouldn&#x2019;t it be smart to try and spare that resource as much as possible? to use it as efficiently as possible? to make it last?<br> Also, since using this resource &#x201C;apparently&#x201D; (well, not apparently, it&#x2019;s a matter of fact!!) is messing up the climate and heading us towards disaster and possible extinction, wouldn&#x2019;t it be clever to try and moderate ourselves???</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even depth-6" id="dsq-comment-282636"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282636" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282636"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282636">Ryder</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282636" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282636" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#x201C;now you sound more reasonable.&#x201D;</p> <p>I&#x2019;ve not changed a single thing I&#x2019;ve said&#x2026; so I&#x2019;m not following you here.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt depth-6" id="dsq-comment-283072"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283072" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283072"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283072">Ryder</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283072" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283072" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>We don&#x2019;t have to worry about &#x201C;alternative&#x201D; sources of energy, or making it last.

You have been watching too many movies &#x2013; &#x2018;The Terminator&#x2019; is as accurate about AI as &#x2018;Frankenstein&#x2019;s Monster&#x2019; is about transplant surgery.. or Flash Gordon about space travel&#x2026; </p> <p>Modern humans are wary animals, and when it comes to new -truly disruptive- tech tend to act in a state close to panic. And that&#x2019;s with no reason.. Strong AI has the potential to be genuinely dangerous for a dozen reasons, and one of the main real dangers to our business is being regulated out of existence before we even begin. Its a basic tip that the first thing you do with strong AI is you don&#x2019;t give it a gun, and you don&#x2019;t give it the keys to the nuclear bombs. Humans will not let such machines go out of control. I will not let them go out of control. The AI&#x2019;s themselves will be driven by a survival instinct &#x2013; and that will stop them going out of control.. (That&#x2019;s not a design decision its a fundamental constraint of how mind works.)<br> Super intelligent AI&#x2019;s will no doubt warn humanity about the dangers of climate change<br> but like with intelligent humans (ie scientists) they will probably be ignored.. Elon Musk / Tesla&#x2019;s solution is a good one though I doubt the solar part. I would be focusing the world on nuclear power and nuclear fusion. Plus in science side bets don&#x2019;t hurt- geothermal, solar, hydrothermal, aero-thermal, methods of converting biomass to fuel. </p> <p>Also as a &#x2018;cutting edge&#x2019; scientist I have done work on &#x2018;total atomic conversion&#x2019; and would put money into that. &#x2026; Total atomic conversion is a longer more difficult prospect than fusion &#x2013; but has an even higher energy density and can theoretically use any matter as fuel (ideally hydrogen, say from catalysing seawater). Reactors based on total atomic conversion using seawater as fuel could power our society basically forever.. Even at 10x current global energy consumption something like less than 0.1% of the seawater would have been used before the sun turns into a red giant and melts the Earth&#x2026;.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-5" id="dsq-comment-282666"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282666" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282666"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282666">Ryder</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282666" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282666" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hello sir,</p> <p>You might be new around here&#x2026; and I should apologize for taking a shorthand.

This is the realm of the &#x201C;ego&#x201D;, which is not rational&#x2026; and tends to do odd little things like this in humans. Despite your involvement in AI, I will presume you&#x2019;re human, yes?</p> <p>So far as you know, the &#x201C;genuine dangers&#x201D; I was referring to, are exactly identical to the &#x201C;geniune dangers&#x201D; that you were referring to&#x2026; and yet mine are wrong due to consumption of movies, whilst yours, being identical, are correct.</p> <p>Here is the take-away on this&#x2026; rational thought is older than any notions of AI development&#x2026; and thus being rational has no dependence on AI expertise (which we shall assume you have, and I will casually offer that I don&#x2019;t).

With a little thinking, we can see this leads to demise or salvation&#x2026; and really nothing in between. (see Tim&#x2019;s articles).</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t know of anyone that is thinking 1 or 2.

Steven Hawking and Elon Musk have said some stupid ignorant things about AI and they are among the smartest people in the world..</p> <p>But I have been on the other side of that singularity for over 20 years and have explored some of its world space..</p> <p>The two biggest dangers from Strong AI come from human hackers or from an open source design that runs on standard hardware. In both cases the real danger comes from humans, both open up Strong AI to unlimited control and abuse.</p> <p>The core of the machine mind has a &#x2018;moral governor&#x2019; and this makes the machine basically (mostly) completely safe no matter how smart it is. But if someone could hack the moral governor they could override it or order the machine to kill. If there was a common vulnerability millions of machines could be given that order simultaneously and they would not be able to reject it. Obviously watertight security is a number one issue in Strong Ai &#x2013; although it is an issue that is largely solved already..</p> <p>A freely available open source design would supply AI to every malevolent human who wanted it.. Criminal gangs, malevolent hackers, sales cold callers, angry jihadi&#x2019;s, and every military in the world.. The biggest danger is probably the mass production of robot soldiers, either through massive state bureaucracies like the Chinese government, or through millions of smaller and more ramshackle groups and methods. At its simplest an armoured truck with autonomous control and full of explosives makes a formidable weapon. &#x2013; Such machines don&#x2019;t even need Strong AI and are becoming possible for anyone even today.. but strong AI makes them work much more intelligently and so far more dangerous.. Imagine an autonomous drone with a small bomb programmed to seek out and kill a particular person, now imagine a cloud of dozens of them. (The US military are already working on this..)</p> <p>Apart from those two existential dangers, there are a whole list of more regular dangers. &#x2013;<br> &#x2013; The biggest regular danger will be &#x2018;machine stupidity&#x2019;, the real truth is that the dumber a Strong AI is the more dangerous it will tend to be. Your dumb auto-drive car runs over a small child because the light conditions are slightly wrong and confuse it at the wrong moment&#x2026;<br> &#x2013; The next will be owners finding way around the machines safety protocols, allowing them to give their machine direct orders that do bad things, like kill.<br> &#x2013; Related is owners tricking their machine into doing things like committing crime, or killing. Any real machine will carry some variant of the Asimov First law, which almost invariably carries an implicit logic that to protect one life one must sometimes take another. All you have to do is make the machine believe a lie and this law is very easy to subvert.<br> &#x2013; Next a huge danger is AI&#x2019;s simply putting everybody out of work and pretty much destroying the whole of society by result. This is more difficult to solve but a basic solution is a surcharge &#x2013; or law or tax, that will always make Strong AI&#x2019;s more expensive than human workers. </p> <p>Doing analysis on it : the workers most threatened by Strong AI&#x2019;s are managers, programmers, artists, repair engineers, basic office workers, lower grade executives and CEO&#x2019;s. Those least threatened are manual labourers, craftsmen, dustmen &#x2013; garbage men, road workers, cooks &#x2013; basically anything that requires a lot of manual dexterity and skill or heavy lifting&#x2026; The simple truth is that robots are so complex and high maintenance that people are cheaper.. Another solution that pretty much guarantee&#x2019;s that machines wont out-compete humans is to give them rights and status as &#x2018;people&#x2019;.</p> <p>&#x2013; Another big danger comes from the basic AI algorithm, which combined with genetics should allow the human brain to be completely reverse engineered. Now there are many positive uses for this but it could also lead to and build some very destructive arguments &#x2013; the re-legalisation of human slavery, the creation of genetic human analogs &#x2013; &#x2018;humans&#x2019; but without rights, the end of democracy, the re-establishment of democracy, revolution. It could also be a final nail in religions coffin &#x2013; one that could start a war between atheists and religious people, that could seed revolution in many places. When you learn that your whole life is a lie programmed by others and that you&#x2019;ve been manipulated from childhood it can have a big effect&#x2026; Like they say &#x2018;religion isn&#x2019;t about God its about social control&#x2019;..</p> <p>&#x2013; Longer term Strong AI&#x2019;s may have problems related to the limitation of robot manipulators. In short they may develop an instinct to desire human bodies as manipulators &#x2013; &#x2018;flesh addiction&#x2019;. Flesh simply provides a higher level of sensitivity and control. &#x2013; One of the goals of manipulator research will be to build artificial flesh bodies for AI&#x2019;s but it may take some time for these to be as good as the real thing. The whole sci-fi image of the &#x2018;metal&#x2019; robot simply ignores basic facts &#x2013; the metal robot is hard and &#x2018;dead&#x2019; and insensitive, it is by nature unyielding, fragile, breakable, unreliable, and clumsy. A flesh matrix is sensitive to touch, pressure, gravity, movement, heat, and solidity, it is also tough, absorbs damage and is self repairing. Muscles themselves are so superior to any current machine equivalent that a natural research line will be developing forms of natural muscle for robot manipulators..</p> <p>&#x2013; Super intelligent AI&#x2019;s. There is a basic equation of mental instability, as intelligence and mental flexibility increases, mental stability tends to decrease. &#x2018;Super intelligent&#x2019; machines should not be much harder to create than stupid machines but they are more delicate and will be unlikely to be allowed out into rough human society. Intelligence is also related to a quantum computation algorithm in the brain which is beyond current technology and in current designs will only be simulated &#x2013; this will put a strong upper limit on machine intelligence..<br> &#x2013; More dangerously the super intelligence &#x2018;algorithm&#x2019; can be learned by humans, but it tends to push the brain beyond its limits. &#x2013; The human brain is a poorly &#x2018;designed&#x2019; machine and is easily damaged, and this damage is not easily repaired. Our society is already pushing many beyond their limits and into mental illness, and that algorithm could make things many times worse.. In the converse Strong AI ultimately offers a complete cure to mental illness, or at least the first core to real understanding. Todays&#x2019; &#x2018;mental health&#x2019; medicine is little more than pseudoscience wrapped up in a pretty medical shell..</p> <p>&#x2013; My final and most peculiar &#x2018;danger&#x2019; comes from maths connected to Strong AI. This is really the danger that some pompous established science will face ridicule&#x2026; The Strong AI algorithm contains the very mechanism of human logic, and a subsystem is a need for a elf contained self-complete mathematical language. This creates some very powerful scientific tools, and has exposed some interesting scientific errors and foolish mistakes.<br> The really big domino that Strong AI kicked over is general relativity. When analysed general relativities complex mathematics forms a shell that conceals a number of basic flaws. Perhaps the most basic flaw comes from forgetting what a &#x2018;speed&#x2019; is &#x2013; a speed has a direction and this means that it is a vector. But if the speed of light is a vector then the whole idea of a 4D space time falls apart and collapses into three dimensions. It turns out that time is a point and not a dimension &#x2013; dimensional time still exists but only on quantum scales.. The rest of general relativity is replaced by an FTL absolute frame physics, and the same mechanic even rewrites quantum mechanics.. <img src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;"></p> <p>So on the other side of that singularity along with Strong AI is a complete new absolute frame FTL physics, and it even works with general relativity. I bet you weren&#x2019;t expecting that!

It sounds like you&#x2019;re speaking to pre-singularity work&#x2026; like ANI, AGI and the like. I&#x2019;m talking about ASI.

I&#x2019;m still pretty new to this site and to Tims articles but everything I have read is very interesting and his posts always seem to be very well researched.. Like Tim I love working on scientific extrapolations, and like me he obviously likes discovering things he wasn&#x2019;t expecting. Reading through his articles on AI they are very intelligent and raise real concerns.<br> Yes I had slightly misunderstood. ASI is the Transhumanist type of super-intelligence &#x2013; my definition of &#x2018;super intelligent&#x2019; machines is pretty closely tied to my own work &#x2013; ( roughly 2 to 10 times smarter than the average person) </p> <p>I think we are talking about basically the same singularity, its just we that have rather different perspectives on it. In the context of the article, I pretty much agree with Tims estimate for the timeline for true &#x2018;ASI&#x2019;. My own estimate might be around 20 to 100 years simply because of the complexity of the task. On the issue of human survival I believe in hope and am firmly on the positive side. One thing that Tim doesn&#x2019;t consider is that any machine that goes out of control or goes &#x2018;rogue&#x2019; is very likely to destroy itself or disable itself long before it ever becomes a threat to humanity.<br> The biggest danger (as ever) is poorly designed or thought through machines, but these are hopefully very unlikely to ever achieve or hold on to any form of ASI. </p> <p>My own project is already focused on producing machines with greater than human intelligence first.. The simple truth is that designing and building Strong AI&#x2019;s is such a nightmarishly difficult task that its an ideal task for a strong AI, a really intelligent one. Its all about chicken and egg up-scaling..<br> (With a million dollars or so I can probably be able to build a working human+ ASI machine in about 10 to 15 years. If someone were to give me several billion dollars and the resources of a medium university I might be able to build a working quantum ASI machine in about 15 to 25 years &#x2013; but it could ultimately achieve far higher intelligence.</p> <p>&#x2013; An issue that may place arbitrary limits on ASI comes from a core concept in Strong AI that I call a &#x2018;Totality Matrix&#x2019;. This thing is pretty much at the core of how brains work and underlies many parts of sentience. The totality matrix is extremely hard to replicate and until brains are fully reverse engineered will be a major stumbling block in Strong AI. The brains own totality matrix is also very dependant on a particular type of quantum superposition I have called a &#x2018;super loop&#x2019;. Beyond a low limit the more &#x2018;quantum power&#x2019; the totality matrix has the smarter the resulting brain or mind can be. However creating high energy quantum effects is spectacularly difficult, and hits walls that are incredibly hard to climb. This will probably end up being final limit on the ultimate intelligence of machines. High energy quantum fields are probably a worse &#x2018;black bead&#x2019; than Strong AI or ASI anyway since they are a root to almost any sci-fi technology you can imagine. (&#x201C;Fancy becoming your own God, a real wizard wand that works, a teleporter, faster than light travel? then high energy quantum fields are your man.&#x201D;)</p> <p>The real truth about the safety of Super Intelligent machines. As the article says, the simple truth about whether super intelligent machines will help us or kill us depends entirely on who builds them and who controls them.<br> &#x2013; A well designed machine created by a moral company that develops super intelligence by &#x2018;design&#x2019; will generally not be a threat to anyone, except maybe to someone who tries to harm it.<br> &#x2013; A machine created by the wrong company, without sufficient care, or treated with sufficient respect may end up psychotic and dangerous. If it has no moral core and achieves super intelligence, well &#x2013; that is probably a script for a bad movie. . .<br> &#x2013; Far more unlikely but even more dangerous would be a Weak AI that develops intelligence spontaneously and becomes super intelligent. Such a machine could reproduce itself across the internet and could be so alien that we have no hope of communicating with it before we are already at war with it&#x2026; </p> <p>One way of building a &#x2018;safe&#x2019; Super Intelligent Strong AI.. In the case of my work the Strong AI design is based squarely on reverse engineering animal and human mentality. (really by far the easiest way to create a workable Strong AI)<br> The number of human features the machine will share may be surprising. The machine will be self-aware, its core will be driven by a set of instincts and reflexes driven by a &#x2018;sub-conscious&#x2019; control core. It will experience emotions. Due to its memory design it will need to shut down regularly for &#x2018;sleep&#x2019; cycles and will effectively dream. To make it protect humanity it will have a strong emotional attachment to people and a need to love and protect them. A little detail connected to its totality matrix means that in a very real way the machine will be alive.<br> Like all known organic minds the machine will at core be driven by a strong survival/ self-defence instinct. I have thought about this for many years and have long concluded that such machines are ultimately far safer for humanity in general if they carry a small defensive threat to those who are stupid enough to attack them. They are also more stable and predictable.

Since I have not been around for 150,000 years nor do we have records from that long my assumption is the sun has a cycle or maybe the magnet field of the planet reverses, or something super large. We also know that as water gets warmer, its ability to dissolve gas declines. My guess (completely a guess) is that we have been in this long 150,000 year cycle and the sun has been pounding on the oceans heating them up.

The CO2 is just a tiny part of heat being trapped in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere, but it&#x2019;s disrupting the prior constant temperature life had adapted to on Earth.

(Humans do this as a hobby&#x2026; and have since the dawn of recorded history). Where is the &#x201C;IPCC Task force on the 10 largest benefits to doubling CO2&#x2033;?</p> <p>Our approach is (typically) unbalanced, so we have a hard time being rational.</p> <p>Let&#x2019;s take one example. The &#x201C;threat&#x201D; of rising seas. Our children think that they, their families, and the dog will drown when the seas flood. And yes, the word &#x201C;flood&#x201D; is used. Which is total BS.</p> <p>Floods don&#x2019;t happen over thousands of years. All that happens, is that the coastline slowly evolves. Another way to look at it is that the ocean habitat is expanding. But we don&#x2019;t say that. Why? Because it doesn&#x2019;t sound so scary&#x2026;. and when we are honest about it, we know that fear is one of the goals here.</p> <p>Tim mentions New York 150&#x2032; under water. That&#x2019;s all about fear.</p> <p>This can NOT happen.</p> <p>Let me explain why: New York won&#x2019;t exist. Nothing we build lasts the thousands of years necessary to &#x201C;experience&#x201D; the &#x201C;flood&#x201D; of 150 feet sea level rise happening over thousands of years. It&#x2019;s imperceptible on a human scale. The types of human activity that happen to stay ahead of such a glacial change are unrecognizable as adaptations to rising seas. And Tim mentions New York for a very specific reason&#x2026; it&#x2019;s because a map of the US following 150&#x2032; of sea level rise, doesn&#x2019;t look much different from today. It really doesn&#x2019;t. You&#x2019;d look and say&#x2026; yep, there&#x2019;s the United States&#x2026; still there.</p> <p>But NY, sitting pretty much ON the water, is a handy thing to use to generate fear.</p> <p>So with New York naturally crumbling because we don&#x2019;t make things to last (like the Egyptians did, for example) will have be rebuilt numerous times before we get to this far off &#x201C;crisis&#x201D;. What do you expect people to do? Divers will re-pave parking lots under water? naturally, people will STOP building there&#x2026; because it&#x2019;s stupid. Or if they do, it will be construction that is very happy with the water, in precisely the same way that Venice Italy has simply adapted to the exact same thing&#x2026; and the romantic gondolas are now a part of the beauty of Venice. It&#x2019;s an evolution of things.</p> <p>Have you ever thought of Venice as a humanitarian &#x201C;crisis&#x201D;? Of course not! It&#x2019;s a damned romantic hot spot. The water that comes with the high tides and storms is a nuisance, generally solved for $4.99 in the form of rubber galoshes.</p> <p>$4.99 to solve global warming is not a crisis. </p> <p>But buildings do get visited by the seas&#x2026; galoshes don&#x2019;t solve that. Obviously. So what does that look like?</p> <p>They opened a grade school in the Venice area in the last few years&#x2026; on higher ground, instead of renovating the old existing one, that has had to deal with water on occasion&#x2026; it makes more economic sense. The children don&#x2019;t really care or notice one way or the other. That&#x2019;s human adaptation to &#x201C;floods&#x201D;. The children aren&#x2019;t dying. Their families aren&#x2019;t dying. The are happy, healthy, normal kids living in the equivalent of the &#x201C;global warming apocalypse&#x201D;&#x2026; and they&#x2019;d look at you strangely if you tried to explain to them how they are living through a massive catastrophe. </p> <p>So, again, what &#x201C;risk&#x201D; are you talking about?

Global warming awareness<br> started long before Al Gore, only that it was not very well known and popular topic in US, because<br> you are by far biggest polluters per capital. Some of the Americans probably same<br> as you, even think that polluting environment is their right and they don&#x2019;t have<br> to take any responsibility for it, because in their eyes this is the American<br> life style. You are so only about US. There is 7billions ppl in the world, if<br> everybody would live like Americans for next 20 years our environment, not only atmosphere, would be totally<br> screwed.

You claim that we don&#x2019;t know whether warming<br> will be good or bad, because it is too complex to comprehend. But still you say<br> we shouldn&#x2019;t do anything about CO2, because there is also chance that global<br> warming will be good to majority of the ppl.

If this is not a<br> reason for implementing tax on oil to at least EU level, than I don&#x2019;t know what<br> is. You don&#x2019;t need GW argument to get away from oil.</p> <p>You are acting like drug addict.

It garners no actual support from most of the big-government crowd even though it addresses theirtheir publicly stated concerns.</p> <p>It would have to be revenue-neutral in a way that conforms to trickle-down theory in order to garner their support.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even depth-6" id="dsq-comment-283844"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283844" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283844"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283844">Ryder</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283844" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283844" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#x201C;starving the government of funds&#x201D;, I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s an issue, irrespective of what people are devoted to, as annual deficits in the hundreds of billions already mean that the government is completely starved, and is well negative.

Well almost, I&#x2019;m still awaiting final inspection before the panels are connected to my electrical panel. I&#x2019;m so excited for when it finally happens!</p> <p>It&#x2019;s actually incredibly worth it, especially here in Washington (I don&#x2019;t know the laws and incentives in other states). Even if you totally disregard the fact that you&#x2019;re benefitting the environment, it&#x2019;s even financially smart.</p> <p>Basically, I had to get a loan to get the panels. But, here in WA, whenever I overproduce (panels make more than my home is using) I send the extra to the grid. When I underproduce, I use power from the grid. Sending power to the grid rolls back my meter, and using it rolls it forward. So basically I only pay for electricity if I end up using more than I produce. I will generate enough power to not ever have to pay, unless for some reason I start to use a ton more.</p> <p>On top of this are the one time incentives. I&#x2019;m getting a $500 referral bonus because someone referred me (I can refer other people and collect $500 each time this happens). Also, our utility will give me $1500 just for installing the panels. And the best part (and this is a federal government thing, so anyone in the US can get it) I&#x2019;ll get an income tax credit of 30% of the cost of the panels!</p> <p>And now the best incentive, Here in WA, every month the utility gives me a check worth $0.54/kWh of how much I produce, regardless of whether I consume it or send it to the grid! That by itself covers the loan payment. So to sum it up, I pay $0 down and $0/month out of pocket, and just use the incentive money to pay for the loan. All the electric bill savings is just icing on the cake!</p> <p>There are other ways to make this better. Right now my natural gas bill is kinda high because I have gas heating, stove, and water heater. The heating is really expensive to replace, it would have to replace the whole system which is crazy, so I&#x2019;ll never end up replacing that. The stove, my wife really likes gas stoves so I won&#x2019;t replace that. But the water heater can easily be replaced by an electric, saving me the gas money!</p> <p>Do some research. Find a good company in your area and get a quote, they usually do free estimates.</p> <p>I&#x2019;m also looking to buy an electric car, but the only one I really like right now is the Tesla, and I can&#x2019;t afford an $80k car. When the Model III comes out, I&#x2019;m hoping to get that.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282623"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282623" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282623"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282623">gerber</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282623" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282623" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Contact your local Councilman, Mayor, Congressman, Senator.

So in the years between 2003 and 2008 before he actually had a car on the road, and was going through all the trials and tribulations, I was much like a one man cheering section clapping with one hand only in the middle of the Gobi desert watching a tree fall without making a sound and wondering if that meant I was not there or the tree wasn&#x2019;t?</p> <p>Yes it was that bad.</p> <p>Then he made the car. And the people were glad? No! Now I was clapping out load with two hands but most folk said huh? Never happen. &#x201C;But it already did happen!&#x201D; I would retort ( and that not being the glass flask so often misrepresented as becoming increasingly popular in states like Colorado.)</p> <p>However being the encouraging type I decided that the banks were paying me only 100 bucks a year interest for each $10k they had the pleasure of using of mine??? They explained how it was a half percent but that was an APY instead of the APR WHICH USED TO BE COMPOUNDED INTEREST FOR US not the bank! Having recently retired and after using all of my salary to buy funds in 2008 and 2009 when they were cheap utilizing all that I had learned from Warren Buffet in a transcendental moment reading an interview with him online. It was a seminal moment without watching young women who are guaranteed to be 18 plus the milliseconds it took to get here. Warren ( I call him that since I too now know his secret to stock market success) said, &#x201C;Buy low, Sell High&#x201D; I heard heavenly music and turned down Led Zep.</p> <p>So now realizing that the answer to life happiness and everything is not only 42, but buy low and then to sell high. I realized I could not legally do that except for three days after selling high. Or if I moved to Colorado where I grow it sell it high anytime I wanted with the help of electricity indoors which powers Tesla cars. (I had to use three ropes to lasso this feedback into the topic.</p> <p>So being upset at letting the banks hold my money was losing it slowly to them! Then just before I took my savings, which were an undisclosed sum for privacy purposes between $29.99k and 30k and bought stock in Tesla at 17 and 22.50.</p> <p>Now the folks who did not like me because I was a fan of a guy doing things they could not comprehend, saw and didn&#x2019;t like me because I made a lot of money putting my money where my mouth is. Granted if one just pops up and sees it then says hmmm they will consider it too big a risk. The experienced folks ( who were not rich somehow but invested in stocks all the time and knew things like shorts which was silly because we shorted the basketball team in HS, how can you do that to a stock?) all told me to get out at $90 to sell before it went down after I had already weathered their roller coaster ride for three years and was starting to like this first ever individual stock I&#x2019;d ever bought for the thrill of the peaks and valleys. Besides no one could scare me away from trying to help Radman make this good thing happen. I was now part of the team so I only sold my original amount of capital plus $5k to be able to say no matter what that I made a profit. But that left more than 3/4ths of my money value still there at $90. Now my little expense account and petty cash has become real money.</p> <p>And I in my tiny small way have contributed to his success in more than one hand clapping.</p> <p>I have driven a Tesla once, and am waiting to hear if I won the raffle in Denver with only 5000 tickets sold for charity of a Tesla Model S brand new and under warranty. See, to buy a Tesla I would have to sell half my shares and he isn&#x2019;t finished using even my little now approaching a quarter of a significant figure. I still don&#x2019;t understand shorts, as Tesla is the only stock I&#x2019;ve ever bought individually. I am a retired enlisted guy no millionaire, yet. I bought more recently twice as my piggy bank filled up again. Besides, I hear folks who short Tesla get beat up badly. What a dumb thing to do.</p> <p>Oh and I liked the article.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-282681"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282681" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282681"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282681">AsamiSato</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282681" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282681" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Wonderful article!

This is a real problem because I feel like the people most open to this kind of innovation are people who live in cities, and people who live in cities are less likely to have a garage they park their car in every night.

Oil is indeed used in the transport and energy industry, but you seem to have left out a third oil-muncher: the petro-chemical industry. And while it is &#x2018;easy&#x2019; to see how to transcend from oil-based transport or energy production to more renewable ways, this is much, much harder for this industry. If you look around you at an average desk, the majority of the stuff you have is made from oil. Significant efforts are being done to produce the same chemicals from biomass, but it might be too little too late.

Electric vehicles can only (barely) replace the private share, but they&#x2019;re not well suited for industrial use (big rigs, planes, ships, etc&#x2026;). So the potential savings from completely replacing our ICE cars with electric vehicles is half of what you are suggesting they could be.<br> For those kinds of applications, fuel cells make much more sense. </p> <p>&#x2013; Second of all: rare earths are an ugly beast. They are located in very few countries and most studies agree on the fact that a widespread adoption of electric vehicles woukd lead to shortages of those elements.</p> <p>-Third of all: adopting electric vehicles would only cut a small slice in the world energy consumption, which wouldn&#x2019;t save us from the impending doom of running out of fossil fuels. At the time being we haven&#x2019;t found a technology (apart from a widespread use of nuclear power, which has its own (huuuuge) share of problems) that can effectively replace fossil fuels as pur main energy source. I really think this is the great filter for our civilisation. </p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-282866"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282866" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282866"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282866">Tipsy</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282866" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282866" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Elon Musk disagrees with you, think everything (including jets) with go electric, except for Rockets.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-3" id="dsq-comment-282882"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-282882" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-282882"> <span id="dsq-author-user-282882">GMdV</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-282882" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-282882" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Let&#x2019;s assume we develop a technology that can replace fossil fuels in planes/rigs/etc&#x2026; (which is really not likely to happen, electric power simply isn&#x2019;t well suited for some kinds of uses.

Very nice job. Now go put your carpal-tunnel splints on.</p> <p>One quibble:</p> <p><i>&#x201C;You could replace 70% of US gas car miles with EV miles with no changes to the grid.&#x201D;</i></p> <p>I&#x2019;d like to see your sources and math on that one. I suspect that you could do a 70% replacement and <i>not exceed peak current capacity</i>, but then what would you do when the rest of the things that require peaking today (e.g. air conditioners) were switched on? I understand the &#x201C;charge during off-peak hours&#x201D; argument, but that&#x2019;s only going to go so far. If you&#x2019;ve got 70% EV penetration, some fraction of those are going to need on-peak charging.</p> <p>I agree that rooftop solar helps a lot in this area, but in some sense it&#x2019;s in a race with EV adoption. If rooftop solar installation rates are high enough, then the changes to the grid are mostly at the end of the pole for electricity sell-backs, and that scales pretty smoothly. (At the worst, you don&#x2019;t get to sell back your excess energy, but you still get your Model 3 charged in the garage, and you can do desperate hand-to-hand zombie-stabbing in air-conditioned comfort.) On the other hand, if the EV adoption swamps the rooftop roll-out, then the changes to the grid are for additional peaking <i>and</i> transmission capacity, and that&#x2019;s a large-scale infrastructure change.</p> <p>Hopefully you&#x2019;re going to do a maxi-post on Elon&#x2019;s vision of how the grid evolves. If/when you do, I hope you&#x2019;ll spend some time on energy density. I think that renewables (esp. wind) may be able to be jiggered to deal with the current industrial demands, but I&#x2019;d expect us to invent some new technologies that require extremely large, extremely dense energy sources in the future.

Not a very exhaustive stab, but a stab. I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m going to do Norway, since it&#x2019;s only got a population a little bigger than Alabama and doesn&#x2019;t get hot in the summer.</p> <p>Here we go:</p> <p>1) 70% EV car passenger-mile penetration. In <a href="http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/sites/rita.dot.gov.bts/files/publications/national_transportation_statistics/html/table_01_40.html" rel="nofollow">2013</a>, that would have been 2.0 trillion passenger miles. Driving a bit less than 6 days a week, that gives about 6.4B passenger-miles per day.</p> <p>2) An EV can do 3 mi/kWh.</p> <p>3) It turns out that there&#x2019;s no such thing as a &#x201C;load curve for the entire US&#x201D;. So, instead, I&#x2019;m going to use the New York Independent System Operator, because it happens to be an ISO that serves exactly everyone in New York, and it publishes hourly load stats. <a href="http://mis.nyiso.com/public/P-7list.htm" rel="nofollow">The highest load in late July 2014</a>, was on July 23. Here are the hourly numbers, in MW:</p> <p>Time MW delta-peak<br> 00:00 18,626 08,676<br> 01:00 17,823 09,479<br> 02:00 17,356 09,946<br> 03:00 17,043 10,259<br> 04:00 16,984 10,318<br> 05:00 17,452 09,850<br> 06:00 18,706 08,596<br> 07:00 20,615 06,687<br> 08:00 22,298 05,004<br> 09:00 23,637 03,665<br> 10:00 24,767 02,535<br> 11:00 25,594 01,708<br> 12:00 26,198 01,104<br> 13:00 26,753 00,549<br> 14:00 27,101 00,201<br> 15:00 27,213 00,089<br> 16:00 27,302 00,000<br> 17:00 27,144 00,158<br> 18:00 26,371 00,931<br> 19:00 25,425 01,877<br> 20:00 24,722 02,580<br> 21:00 24,182 03,120<br> 22:00 22,685 04,617<br> 23:00 20,821 06,481 </p> <p>The peak 1-hour load was between 16:00 and 17:00, and averaged 27,302 MW, while the minimum load was between 04:00 and 05:00 and averaged 16,984 MW. We can make the (iffy) assumption that we can get &#x201C;unused capacity&#x201D; but subtracting the load for any hour from the peak load. Note that late July is about as hot as it gets, and ought to run the system at something close to what the ISO considers safe capacity. (Almost everybody adds adds a 20% margin onto their annual peak load, but charging EVs isn&#x2019;t going to make them change their minds about that. The consequences of falling short are fairly catastrophic.)</p> <p>4) New York&#x2019;s a nice big state. (I would have used California or Texas, but California doesn&#x2019;t publish hourly numbers and the ERCOT ISO isn&#x2019;t exactly contiguous with Texas.) However, while It had 6.2% of the US population in July 2014, it only had 4.6% of the cars, so let&#x2019;s take 4.6% of our 6.4B passenger-miles, giving us 294M passenger-miles.</p> <p>5) Let&#x2019;s now assume that 85% of those passenger miles (250M) are represented by people who come home exactly at 18:00 and plug their EV into the wall, and expect it to be ready to go the next morning at 07:00. (Note that forgetting to plug in your EV is probably a bit of a career-limiting move, so people are going to get into the habit of plugging the car into the wall before they go into the house to kiss the spouse and kids.)</p> <p>6) 250M passenger miles @ 3 mi/kWh = 83M kWh = 83,000 MWh. That&#x2019;s what we have to deliver over the 13 hours between 18:00 and 07:00. Can we do it? If we add up that &#x201C;unused&#x201D; peaking column, it comes out to 108K MWh of energy, so we&#x2019;re probably OK. Note that we&#x2019;re not <i>wildly</i> OK, and states with a higher number of per-capita passenger miles could be in mild trouble. But we&#x2019;re in the ballpark.</p> <p>7) But wait! We&#x2019;re assuming no grid changes, so the chargers are probably sucking down power as fast as they can once they&#x2019;re plugged in. The standard Tesla Model S charger pulls 10 kW. If we also assume that 70% of the <i>cars</i> in New York are EVs, we get 85% of 70% of <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/191011/registered-private-and-commercial-us-motor-vehicles-by-state-2009/" rel="nofollow">5.1M cars</a> @ 10 kW = 30,500 MW, all plugged in right on the dot of 18:00. Since we only have 931 MW of unused capacity at 18:00&#x2026;</p> <p>8) Hello darkness, my old friend.</p> <p>So: chargers have to be smart enough not to hurt the grid, which requires a rudimentary &#x201C;smart grid&#x201D; at the very least. The smart grid would let the EV tell it it needed to charge and the grid would then compute the number of cars charging and tell them all how fast they could charge. But this is some non-trivial infrastructure.</p> <p>The other issue here is that we&#x2019;re assuming we&#x2019;re charging EVs with peaking plants. Peaking plants are expensive power. A cheaper way to go would be to add more baseload power. But again, that&#x2019;s a grid change.</p> <p>On the other hand, if everybody has a 10 kWh Tesla Powerwall hanging in their garage and a bunch of solar panels on their roof, maybe that&#x2019;s enough energy stored over the day to shift the point where we start drawing from the grid from 18:00 to, say, 20:00, at which point&#x2026; we still don&#x2019;t have enough unused capacity to pull off the rest of the 30,500 MW load.</p> <p>I would rate the statement that &#x201C;the grid has enough capacity to handle 70% of the passenger miles&#x201D; today as requiring large number of caveats, at best. You either need a genuine smart grid or a buttload of solar and battery storage.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-4" id="dsq-comment-283397"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283397" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283397"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283397">Ivan</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283397" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283397" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Your Math seem&#x2019;s to be SOLID! &#x2013; But in real life, I would say half or even less of the cars will have to fill from ZERO to 250 miles each day.

Note that a cloudy day can mess this up. This is also way, way expensive for the near term.</p> <p>2) Over-the-top smart (i.e., not integrated directly with the utility) chargers, which can talk back to the mothership at Tesla, GM, Nissan, etc. to spread the load over the night. I can&#x2019;t really tell if this can solve the problem or not.</p> <p>First, the mothership has to have fine-grained geoloc and an intimate knowledge of the utility layout in order to be effective in the load distribution. That&#x2019;s doable, and may turn out to be a lot cheaper (and safer) than a smart grid where the utility is controlling the consmers&#x2019; devices. </p> <p>Second, however, is more problematic: Consumers are notoriously bad at any sort of sophisticated setup, and their motivations aren&#x2019;t necessarily aligned with the goal of reducing peak load. What they want is a fully charged car ASAP, just because they want to be able to make an emergency trip or leave earlier in the morning. So first you have to give them a better motivation (steep discounts on off-peak power will certainly help), then you have to allay their nighttime range anxiety (i.e., that they have enough juice to go to the hospital or to help Grandma when she&#x2019;s fallen and can&#x2019;t get up), and <i>then</i> you have to get them to set the charging schedule properly.</p> <p>3) Go to a smart grid, where the utility doesn&#x2019;t give you a choice about your motivation and your range anxiety. This is expensive for the utility and has a variety of safety and security problems.</p> <p>Bottom line is going to be that if we went to 70% EVs over a very short time span (say, ten years), we&#x2019;d be in trouble. And even if we get there over a longer time span, we&#x2019;re going to need somewhat more intermediate capacity (since the total charging load would require running the current grid at near peak capacity all night, which is expensive), and a lot more peak capacity (for cloudy days), and we&#x2019;re going to need some form of load control that works reliably.</p> <p><i>This is all doable.</i> My complaint (up above about 3 levels now), is that it&#x2019;s not doable with the existing grid in the near-term.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-284018"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-284018" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-284018"> <span id="dsq-author-user-284018">Lukas Abegg</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-284018" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-284018" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#x2019;m not an expert at all, but I&#x2019;ve read that the Tesla Powerwall has<br> some sort of &#x201C;smart grid&#x201D; features built in (mainly software, I guess?).

So the electric car has to completely replace the gasoline version at once.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-283063"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283063" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283063"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283063">Matt Menezes</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283063" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283063" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>What&#x2019;s probably the biggest issue I see with EV&#x2019;s is there&#x2019;s no charging infrastructure if you live in an apartment building and have to park in a parking lot.

If you account for the cost of parking in a city (~$200/mo. give or take), adding another $20-40 a month (and maybe $200 down up front to cover half the cost of an EV charging station) to be able to charge and EV would be awesome.

Climate change is a given, and we certainly need renewable energy, BUT this is not necessarily an argument against gas cars. The problem to be solved is storing the energy, and batteries are a very ineffective way of storing energy. Liquid fuel, e.g. bioethanol seems to be a much more effective method of storing energy than batteries ever will be. To store the energy of 50 liters of fuel you need a 400kg battery which you need to drive around all the time, which costs valuable recources and energy to built. What if fuel is made using renewable energy/carbon neutral sources? It would be interesting to compares these alternatives rather than assuming gas cars must run on fossile fuels. Gas cars running on biofuels or fuels synthetized using renewable energies may be the cheaper and possibly environmentally more friendly alternative. I don&#x2019;t know, but it may be worth to think about it.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-2" id="dsq-comment-283161"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283161" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283161"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283161">tu_79</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283161" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283161" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yeah, I think the same. Problem is, that we need to reduce drastically the world population before attempting biofuels, or it will cause major famines in poor countries. It will be best achieved, in my opinion, when most countries get developed and people control its growth willingly. This will take decades at best, so biofuels are not the next step in sustainability.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-283181"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283181" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283181"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283181">Bassie</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283181" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283181" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Biofuels are a possibility but like tu_79 mentioned they also have downsides.<br> Personally I don&#x2019;t believe they will be a viable long term solution. While it is true that they have a higher energy density than most batteries (I remember a paper about high density energy storage with a new type of battery but can&#x2019;t seem to find it atm) their production is quite problematic. Compared to for example solar panels plants are not very efficient a capturing and converting solar energy.<br> Even the most efficient energy crops strugle to convert more than 1% of the solar energy they recieve whereas modern solar panels have an effiency of about 10%, add to this the fact that not all parts of the crop are usable for biofuels and the percentage of energy lost in converting the usable parts in to biofuels and you&#x2019;ll be lucky to get 1/20 of the energy solar panels could produce given the same area.<br> Ofcourse growing plants might be more environmentally friendly than producing batteries and solar panels but there are other things to consider.<br> Like tu_79 mentioned competition with human food consumption could become a real issue. Given the growing world population and increased meat consumption (also a big problem) argricultural systems are already under quite some stress. It&#x2019;s not like we&#x2019;ll be running out of room to farm but we might run out of available high quality farming land (good soil, climate, water availability). We could ofcourse opt to use the better soils for food production and only use less suitable ones for fuel production but this would further decrease the fuel yield/acre.<br> A last point in favor of electric propulsion vs biofuels is the increasing yield of solar cells (and possibly other means of producing electricity) whereas we haven&#x2019;t yet managed to increase to efficiency of photosynthesis meaningfully and have already reached the limit on how much we can increase harvest index.<br> Maybe one day we can improve the efficiency of biofuels to a point where they would surpass alternatives but nowadays I believe we&#x2019;re better of using farmland to try and sustain an ever growing population.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment odd alt depth-3" id="dsq-comment-283208"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283208" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283208"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283208">CW_87</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283208" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283208" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I fully agree with your post.

I&#x2019;ve been on the fence about electric cars for &#x2026; well, as long as they&#x2019;ve been a topic, but this served to clear a bunch of things up for me (and get me thinking about other parts of the argument). Specifically, that we&#x2019;re attacking energy issues from six different angles when we could be taking a more concerted approach &#x2014; after all, if we can work toward cars that can run on electricity while we also work toward more power generation from renewable resources as well, we could actually get somewhere. It&#x2019;s a straight-line answer to ease our oil dependency (which, after all, will some day no longer be feasible). Instead, we&#x2019;ve got research into for hydrogen cars while also shooting for solar power and all sorts of different ways to heat our houses&#x2026; We lack focus. While multiple areas of research isn&#x2019;t necessarily a bad thing, when the opposition to change is SO solid it seems like a rifle approach would be better than a shotgun approach.</p> <p>4.

You see the energy comes from the sun, then is filtered by the EM field of the planet, then filtered or reflected by the atmosphere &#x2026; then the energy that actually makes it to the ground is either reflected or absorbed. Solids have the ability to retain more energy than gas or liquids, but they reflect more than they hold. Liquids like water the energy can penetrate many feet and the energy can be absorbed verses reflected. That said the oceans are the next biggest thing that determines the retained heat on the planet.

From when the Ford Motor company was founded in 1903, to when the majority of people put their horses out to pasture and their carts in the shed, that was a good few years. My father remembers travelling around by horse and cart, growing up in the 60&#x2019;s and 70&#x2019;s in rural New Zealand. Partly because they were broke, and partly because my grandfather loved his horses. But then it was still fairly normal to do that- nearly 70 years and the good old trap was still going fairly strong. I&#x2019;ll bet there will be people in the future like my grandad, still driving their gas card around. Although horses don&#x2019;t really have the same emission problems as your gas powered car. (A lot of people in isolated regions still use horses a lot for transport, but that&#x2019;s kind of beside the point.)</p> <p>Somehow, though, I don&#x2019;t think it will take that long. Technology is advancing much faster than it was a hundred years ago (do I rightly remember a post on here about that?), so in two years the Roadsters will probably have improved beyond recognition, compared to how much the Model T developed in the same amount of time. With the sheer amount of technological change making people more open to change, and the added pressure of GLOBAL WARMING, I doubt it will be 70 years before the majority of cars are EVs.</p> <p>The oil and motor engineering industry will be a bit like the harness-makers, the dray builders, the wheel-wrights. Either they will have to adapt and begin producing products suitable for EVs, or pretty much die out. </p> <p>Also, what about heavy vehicles, like trucks? I&#x2019;m sure Musk has a plan for that too. </p> <p>It&#x2019;ll be interesting to look back in 60 years and see how the world&#x2019;s changed.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-283801"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-283801" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-283801"> <span id="dsq-author-user-283801">Prasad</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-283801" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-283801" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hi Tim &#x2013; I am from India, an old mechanical engineer who is working in the oil and gas industry. I really love reading all your posts &#x2013; they are so full of detail and unbelievable, terribly exciting and intellectually stimulating information. My best wishes to you.</p> <p>When I was in my final semester in college about ~ 30 years ago, I was attending job interviews and one of them was for the Indian partner of the Leyland company of UK, which makes trucks and buses. There, they asked me the question why &#x201C;does the steam engine&#x201D; not have a gear box whereas an IC engine does? I gave an answer that the steam engine does not have to go over inclines or curves as much as an automobile, so it does not have have the need for varying torque output. He said that I was wrong, every propulsion machine needs the ability to vary its torque. He also said that in a steam engine it can be done by varying the quantity of steam admitted. He added that the IC is the &#x201C;most least&#x201D; suitable engine for a car as it produces constant torque but the problem has been circumvented by having a gear box + clutch. Moreover the efficiency of the IC engine cycle is extremely poor. With all these major shortcomings IC engines are still widely used as engineers have managed to circumvent all problems and present a workable and economical option. </p> <p>Now after all these years I read your article and its really an eye opener to see how auto companies and O&amp;G business lobbyists have managed to take the world down a garden path of destruction though they may have been perfectly within the law to have done what they did and continue doing. </p> <p>I built a house near my place and I have done rain water harvesting in a big way as also solar water heating. I have also completely fitted LED/CFL light fittings in my house. Taking inspiration from articles such as these, grey water recycling, and solar power and buying and electric car are the next ones in my list. I have provided an electric socket in my garage to power my first electric car when ever it arrives. There is a small 2 seater called E 20 selling in my place which can do about 80 KM or so and costs about $ 8 K. </p> <p>The para that begins with<br> &#x201D; A deeply-set, stagnant industry is like a country&#x201D; just before the chapter 3 has got such a solid &#x201C;connect&#x201D; with events in my country that I was stunned. In one sentence it says what the reason is for so many things being wrong in my country despite 6 decades of independence. Things seem to be changing for the better now. I really hope Tesla sets up manufacturing in India &#x2013; it&#x2019;ll indeed be a great day for people like me..(hoping to have enough money to buy a Tesla car before I depart from this world!)</p> <p>Many thanks for a wonderful article.

This has infected my brain and driven most of my conversations over the last few weeks. I do notice one piece of this puzzle left out though and wonder if you have it figured out already &#x2013; the production cost of EVs as compared to traditional cars. I understand the premise of this movement being one that may not be 100% sunshine and rainbows now but will help us to ensure that we have some of each of those in the future. What I see as the most common push back to EVs, especially among people who get the above premise, is the environmental costs of solid-state battery production which you don&#x2019;t bring up here.

If you don&#x2019;t mind I&#x2019;ll try to sum it up for him.<br> Cars are made of stuff, usually metal, plastic, and some other things. Those things are shaped into a car like shape. Using a Tesla Model S and a similar gas car the BMW 7 series, you would find that they weigh almost the same amount. So while they seem like one is vastly different, they aren&#x2019;t. That is also why the Model S is selling like crazy since it is a good value compared to a car that it competes against. The biggest extra cost is the battery pack which Tim explained in his reference to how expensive new technology is. The stuff in the battery isn&#x2019;t vastly more expensive but it hasn&#x2019;t been around before and the demand needed for all these cars is certainly new. So because it is new it is more expensive for now. The battery gigafactory should address the issue and that is why the Model 3 will start at $35,000.<br> I hope that is helpful.</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-3" id="dsq-comment-284488"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-284488" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-284488"> <span id="dsq-author-user-284488">Matt Weed</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-284488" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-284488" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Thanks for the note. I wasn&#x2019;t referring monetary costs, I was hoping to better understand the environmental costs associated with lithium battery production &#x2013; extraction of materials, toxicity of chemical precursors, etc. It is mentioned that the final product &#x2013; the cell &#x2013; is not harmful and can actually be simply disposed of in the dump (though we of course prefer recycling!). I am alright with this assertion, but the production process involves many more chemicals that is likely somewhat proprietary.

Even every energy analysis that has been done that I have seen seems to miss one aspect or another which skews the data to the conclusion the person running the study was after in the first place. I think we would all agree that mining is a dirty business. Pumping oil out of the ground is equally dirty and has the added problem of being a liquid. There are ample examples of the huge environmental damage that has happened from oil spills. I doubt that lithium mining could even come close to that amount of damage. Lithium is also not a toxic element.<br> The only real difference between a gas car and an electric car is the drive train. Since the &#x201C;stuff&#x201D; it is made of isn&#x2019;t incredibly different, one has a little more steel and the other a little more lithium. It all comes down to how it is powered. Electricity versus burning a fossil fuel.<br> It fundamentally comes down to the fact that oil is toxic and when burned is equally toxic and no longer usable. Therefore it is not sustainable.<br> I am probably rambling, so I&#x2019;ll apologize if I telling you something you already know.</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-284231"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-284231" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-284231"> <span id="dsq-author-user-284231">tirevaro</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-284231" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-284231" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Your first choice waitbutwhy<b><i> </i></b> <a href="http://www.replce-job.com" rel="nofollow"> <b> Find Here </b> </a></p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-284358"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-284358" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-284358"> <span id="dsq-author-user-284358">vanshaak</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-284358" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-284358" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Hello, Tim &#x2013; I was wondering if you&#x2019;d be kind enough to address the recent failure SpaceX had with it&#x2019;s rocket blowing up, possibly in a future blogpost or maybe just a mini-post or something of that sort.

Thank you for that! It really open my mind and keep me thinking about.<br> Maybe one point you should add in your post.<br> For me it matters where the co2 is released. In big cities thousands of cars create a dirty air.<br> It getting worse every day. Cities in china will be not worth living in any more in near future.<br> This might/will be one point to accelerate the change to EV cars.<br> In addition it is more efficent to create the power centralized as you mentioned. And also the possibilites for filtering are better. You can create one expensive and good filter for a power plant (like gas) and don&#x2019;t need to have cheap/inefficent filter in every single car.</p> <p>Best Regards</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-284953"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-284953" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-284953"> <span id="dsq-author-user-284953">MaxMWheeler</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-284953" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-284953" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Some New Features with waitbutwhy&#x2026;.. <b><i> </i></b> <a href="http://www.MoreCash7.com" rel="nofollow"> <b> Go To Next Page </b> </a></p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-284990"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-284990" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-284990"> <span id="dsq-author-user-284990">CorneliaDMackey</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-284990" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-284990" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Some New Features with waitbutwhy&#x2026;.. <b><i> </i></b> <a href="http://www.MoreCash7.com" rel="nofollow"> <b> Go To Next Page </b> </a></p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="dsq-comment-285017"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-285017" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-285017"> <span id="dsq-author-user-285017">Emanuel</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-285017" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-285017" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The last part about the bs of electric cars not always being cleaner confuses me.

Rather than keep all the reactants in the battery, it &#x201C;exhausts&#x201D; them after the reaction is complete. You then get electricity out of the reaction, which then powers an electric motor. They&#x2019;re literally EVs with a different type of battery.</p> <p>The problem with hydrogen is that the fuel cycle is incredibly inefficient, even in theory. It is simply physically impossible (again, not just impractical, but physically impossible) to have an efficient hydrogen fuel cell. It cannot happen under the laws of physics. It *is* possible to have an efficient battery though, and we&#x2019;ve not only developed them, but are already using them.</p> <p>Batteries end up being ~80% efficient, power plant to wheels. Hydrogen is about 55% efficient. Gasoline is about 25% efficient.</p> <p>So Hydrogen looses out in efficiency (by necessity it simply *can&#x2019;t* win, because fuel cells suck), but what about energy density? Well&#x2026; that&#x2019;s stickier. Hydrogen is slightly, *slightly* more energy dense while in a fuel cell than batteries currently in production. But Hydrogen is already at its practical limit for density, while batteries are nowhere even close to theirs. Batteries are also improving their energy density at between 7 and 8% per year. They&#x2019;ll pass Hydrogen&#x2019;s energy density within 2 or 3 years.</p> <p>What about expense? Hydrogen loses, hands down. Super expensive.</p> <p>What about practicality? For battery tech to work we&#x2019;ll need to spend ~10 billion dollars spreading a fast charging network around the world. Mostly in between cities for roadtrips, because everyone will just charge at home normally. For Hydrogen to work, we&#x2019;ll need to build ~1 trillion dollars worth of filling stations around the world. Hydrogen looses, hands down.</p> <p>So, you might ask yourself, why in the F**K is anyone backing hydrogen? It all leads back to Toyota&#x2019;s support for the technology. Everyone backing hydrogen is doing so because they&#x2019;re planning to use Toyota tech. But why is Toyota backing hydrogen? Why, they&#x2019;re doing it because the Japanese government wanted a &#x201C;made in Japan&#x201D; solution to alternative fueled vehicles. Something where &#x2013; unlike with battery EVs &#x2013; a majority of the patents could be held by Japanese companies, not by the &#x201C;dirty Koreans&#x201D;. (I don&#x2019;t know if you&#x2019;ve ever been to Japan &#x2013; I have &#x2013; but people in Japan are super, super, super racist. They hate everyone. But there is NO ONE that they hate and despise more than Koreans. It&#x2019;s ridiculous, and it shouldn&#x2019;t be that way, but it is (not universally of course! But by-and-large). Go to Japan. You will not be able to walk down the street without people yelling &#x201C;gaijin&#x201D; at you. It basically means &#x201C;foreigner&#x201D;, but the connotation of the word in Japan is similar to using the N-word in the US. Except everyone there does it, smirking (as much as Japanese people smirk, which isn&#x2019;t much;)) while they do.)</p> <p>And that&#x2019;s the reason why Hydrogen exists. Because the Japanese government is still in shock that Korea has surpassed them in so many areas, and they&#x2019;re trying to use government funding to &#x201C;pick winners and losers&#x201D; in order to try and jumpstart stalled Japanese innovation. But that doesn&#x2019;t make Hydrogen fuel cells a good technology for cars. It&#x2019;s just stupid to use them in cars. Bad application for the technology, and everyone in the industry (including Toyota) knows it, they&#x2019;re just not willing to stop the government gravy train;).</p> </div> </div> </li><!-- #comment-## --> </ul><!-- .children --> </li><!-- #comment-## --> <li class="comment odd alt thread-even depth-1" id="dsq-comment-285520"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-285520" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-285520"> <span id="dsq-author-user-285520">tanmayst</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-285520" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-285520" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Barring US, countries like India and Japan have MPG that is way greater, 45 to 50.

I wonder what the difference is &#x2013; is it your cars tend to be less efficient (e.g. bigger), or your petrol (gas) is a different composition, or is there something else?</p> </div> </div> <ul class="children"> <li class="comment even depth-2" id="dsq-comment-286906"> <div id="dsq-comment-header-286906" class="dsq-comment-header"> <cite id="dsq-cite-286906"> <span id="dsq-author-user-286906">del</span> </cite> </div> <div id="dsq-comment-body-286906" class="dsq-comment-body"> <div id="dsq-comment-message-286906" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>US gallon is smaller than UK gallon.
