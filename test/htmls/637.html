The problem seems to be that everyone&#x2019;s okay with consuming less, as long as they don&#x2019;t have to do more.</p> </div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Lazy, right?</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>So the good news is that overall calorie consumption is down. The average person is consuming less, and the category they&#x2019;re consuming the least of is added <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-3175529/Americans-eating-healthier-calorie-consumption-falling-people-drink-25-cent-soda.html" target="_blank">sugars and sodas</a>.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>The bad news is that more Americans are now considered obese than overweight, which would seemingly indicate that the fattest among us have <a href="http://www.latimes.com/science/la-sci-sn-more-americans-obese-than-overweight-20150620-story.html" target="_blank">gotten fatter</a>.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Those things might seem to contradict themselves, but if you look at the data, it&#x2019;s showing a particular lifestyle is to blame for our hefty issues. Here&#x2019;s the hard, blubbery fact: People are eating better, but they&#x2019;re probably not taking care of themselves. &#x201C;It is clear that the obesity rate in America has increased and continued to steadily increase,&#x201D; says Yikyung Park, an associate professor at Washington University.</p> </div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Park says that even if calorie intake has been dropping over the last decade, it&#x2019;s only part of the problem. &#x201C;To maintain a healthy weight, the energy eaten has to come out,&#x201D; says Park.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>And we&#x2019;re not doing that as a society. Park says the data shows that &#x201C;physical activity being done in America has gone down. People are not moving enough. And lifestyles are becoming sedentary.&#x201D; Park points to screens as part of the problem, but also acknowledges transportation is a factor. &#x201C;More people are spending time playing video games, [watching] TV, not walking, and car sales have gone up since the 1980s.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/pullquote"><blockquote class="pullquote"><p>&#x201C;Physical activity being done in America has gone down. People are not moving enough. And lifestyles are becoming sedentary.&#x201D;</p></blockquote></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Park hadn&#x2019;t seen the calorie study, but confirmed that although some studies may now show that calorie count is going down, &#x201C;even if we assume that calories are going down it doesn&#x2019;t mean that people&#x2019;s physical activity has gone up. If people are eating less but also they are not moving around,&#x201D; she explains, &#x201C;it means again that there is an energy imbalance. People are not moving enough to burn those extra calories, and will gain weight over time.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Park also says that we&#x2019;re compounding the problem when the extra calories come from nutritionless sources. &#x201C;If the extra calories are coming from unhealthy food, it&#x2019;s a problem for obesity and all other chronic conditions people are suffering from nowadays.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>So while the nutrition findings may mean a step in the right direction, people literally have to start taking extra steps.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not just a problem with one part. It&#x2019;s all entangled. It&#x2019;s really hard to tease out diet and activity from one person&#x2019;s life,&#x201D; says Park. &#x201C;Generally people who tend to eat a healthy diet, those are the ones who probably move around a little more.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>That&#x2019;s why people have to attack both parts of the problem, but there&#x2019;s a big caveat here: Most physicians still recommend you start with one piece of the puzzle if you&#x2019;re trying to make life changes. &#x201C;You cannot make changes all at once,&#x201D; Park says. &#x201C;It has to be kind of step by step.&#x201D;</p> </div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Bottom line: Dropping soda or cutting calories to a healthy level is good. And it&#x2019;s a good start, especially if they&#x2019;re nutritionally void ones. &#x201C;If people start cutting down those empty calories either from soda, or from alcohol intake, certainly in the long run you will see weight decrease,&#x201D; Park says. &#x201C;There are numerous studies showing all those added sugars in those beverages clearly show increased risk for diabetes and other diseases. It has consequences&#x2026; so cutting back added sugar will be a good first step to lose weight or for healthy people to maintain weight.&#x201D;</p> </div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Now when we&#x2019;re going to get our healthy lunches, we need to start taking the stairs, too.</p></div></section><footer><div class="amazon-btn" style="display:none; position: relative;"><div class="amazon-btn-icon"><img src="/etc/clientlibs/dailybeast2/img/amzn_favicon_blk.png"></div><div class="amazon-btn-title">Shop &#x25BE;</div><div class="amazon-btn-placement" data-content-path="/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/01/we-re-eating-less-calories-but-are-fatter-than-ever" data-tracking-id="thedailybeast-tech-health-20"></div></div><ul class="sharetools"><li class="sharetool facebook"><a class="icon-facebook facebook-popup" aria-hidden="true" data-link="http://thebea.st/1UdLgZA" data-picture="http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/01/we-re-eating-less-calories-but-are-fatter-than-ever/jcr:content/image.img.200.jpg/1438394411042.cached.jpg" data-name="We&amp;rsquo;re Eating Less Calories But Are Fatter Than Ever" data-description="The good news: Americans are consuming less calories.
