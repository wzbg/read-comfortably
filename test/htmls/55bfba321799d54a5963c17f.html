the anniversary of the &ldquo;handover,&rdquo; as it&rsquo;s known here &mdash; as a day of demonstration, with thousands marching through the sweltering metropolis to air their political grievances. It makes sense: after all, under the political agreement between the U.K. and China, Hong Kong would operate as a quasi-democracy under the umbrella of Chinese rule, and in the democratic imaginary, the right to assembly is axiomatic.<\/p>\n<p>Beyond that, though, there are no real reliable axioms when it comes to democracy in Hong Kong, other than that, for this Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China, democracy itself may be an illusion. Nine months have passed since the beginning of the Umbrella Revolution, when hundreds of thousands of Hong Kongers besieged the city&rsquo;s busiest districts to push for a greater say in how their leader is chosen. But, 12 days ago, Hong Kong lawmakers vetoed the government&#8217;s showpiece electoral bill because it required all candidates for the city&#8217;s top job to undergo screening by Beijing. It is now highly unlikely that the central government will consider other reform proposals for some time.<\/p>\n<p>That leaves the pro-democracy movement at an impasse. At last year&rsquo;s July 1 demonstrations &mdash; in hindsight, a prologue to the Umbrella Revolution &mdash; Hong Kongers called for political upheaval; today, they gather to sit shivah for the stalemate, but also to contemplate their next move.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;This is a day when we restart our campaign &mdash; when we ask ourselves what we can do next,&rdquo; Johnson Cheung, who leads the pro-democratic Civil Human Rights Front, says.<\/p>\n<p>The Hong Kong government is also groping for a way forward. As activists <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/politics\/article\/1830508\/cy-leung-says-democratic-system-wont-save-hong-kong\">burned an SAR flag<\/a> outside an official ceremony to mark the 18th anniversary of the handover this morning, Leung Chun-ying, the incumbent chief executive (as the highest official in Hong Kong is called) sought relief in pocketbook issues.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The government needs the support and cooperation of the entire community if we are to boost the economy and improve the livelihood of the people of Hong Kong,&rdquo; he <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/politics\/article\/1830508\/cy-leung-says-democratic-system-wont-save-hong-kong\">told<\/a> assembled dignitaries.<\/p>\n<p>Underscoring the gulf between the city&#8217;s democratic and pro-Beijing camps, Leung also appeared to suggest that a freer political system would not be able to solve Hong Kong&#8217;s serious social ills &mdash; among them appalling income inequality and sluggish social mobility. &ldquo;As the experience of some European democracies shows,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;democratic systems and procedures are no panacea for economic and livelihood issues.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>In the mid-afternoon, thousands began to assemble at Victoria Park &mdash; a rare greensward in this densely packed city, serving as the march&#8217;s starting point and as a traditional place of protest. Many demonstrators carried the colonial-era Hong Kong flag, not as a demonstration of loyalty to Britain but as a defiant assertion of the city&#8217;s origins as an international entrepot and the emblem of what they believe to have been a better time. In contrast to the almost carnival atmosphere of previous marches, the mood this year appeared subdued and numbers appeared notably fewer than previous years. Organizers blamed political fatigue.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;At this point, there&#8217;s not much we can do politically,&#8221; said marcher Thomas Yan, vice chairman of the pro-democracy party People Power. &#8220;All we can do now, and in the future, is focus on civic education &mdash; on informing the people.&#8221;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3942729\"><\/div>\n<p>Marcher Maria Chen agreed that Hong Kong needed to reflect on its next move. &ldquo;I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s next for Hong Kong,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope they listen to us, but I think Hong Kong needs to figure it out for itself. Our future should lie in our hands.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Less than a hundred meters up Hennessy Road, police officers stood between marchers and a group of pro-Beijing demonstrators staging a counter rally. As tensions flared and verbal barbs were traded, the pro-Beijing camp turned up the volume on its loudspeaker and blared the Chinese national anthem &mdash; a melody that Hong Kong soccer supporters have recently taken to jeering at international matches.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;After the democrats vetoed the [government&#8217;s electoral bill], we realized we needed a new direction,&rdquo; Agnes Chow, a senior member of the student activist group Scholarism, told TIME earlier. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re in a very passive position politically, because any attempt at constitutional reform is going to be led by the central government in Beijing.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><em>Passive<\/em> is an interesting choice of word, coming from someone who was at the forefront of the Umbrella Revolution &mdash; the largest and most violent political demonstration in China since the Tiananmen Massacre in 1989. Chow is uncertain what will come next, but is keen to note that tensions continue to mount.<\/p>\n<p>It isn&rsquo;t just rhetoric. Late Sunday night, Joshua Wong, the outspoken 18-year-old activist who has emerged as a figurehead of Hong Kong&rsquo;s democratic zeitgeist, was leaving a movie with his girlfriend when an unknown assailant &ldquo;grabbed [his] neck, and punched [his] left eye,&rdquo; he tells TIME. Earlier that evening and mere blocks away, a group of &ldquo;localists&rdquo; &mdash; those in favor of far greater Hong Kong autonomy, even complete independence, from China &mdash; staged a rally to protest the politically and culturally provocative presence of street musicians from mainland China. Violence quickly erupted between the localists and members of pro-China groups, who turned up to support the musicians.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;My own view is that this is predictable,&rdquo; David Zweig, a professor of social sciences at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, tells TIME. &ldquo;We can see a shift from civil disobedience and towards more violence. People are becoming more frustrated with the fact that Beijing has made no concessions.&rdquo;<b><br \/>\n<\/b><\/p>\n<p>Those on the march appeared to understand this political reality. &ldquo;So long as the Beijing government is insisting we don&#8217;t have a way out, legislative reform can hardly happen,&rdquo; Ken Wu, a 27-year-old social worker, told TIME.<\/p>\n<p>The SAR government is not in a conciliatory mood either. During his address at today&#8217;s official ceremony, Chief Executive Leung spoke of the &#8220;serious threats to social order and the rule of law&rdquo; posed by last year&#8217;s Umbrella Revolution, and warned that the city&#8217;s development would be seriously impeded if democratic legislators continued to block the government&#8217;s legislative agenda.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;All we ask is for the citizens of Hong Kong to respect the system,&rdquo; Po Chun-chung, of the pro-Beijing Defend Hong Kong Campaign, said, as the march went by. Many demonstrators, tired of what they see as the mainland&#8217;s encroachment on the city&#8217;s autonomy, and its reneging on promises of genuine democracy, would like to ask Beijing to do the same.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The [mainland] Chinese have gotten dirtier and dirtier,&rdquo; said Eric, a 32-year-old protester. &ldquo;They get their hands into our lives and we don&#8217;t have any way to fight back.

The violence underscores raw tensions in China&#8217;s most open metropolis, just three days ahead of the 18th anniversary of the city&#8217;s return to Chinese sovereignty.<\/p>\n<p>Trouble began when so-called &#8220;localist&#8221; groups &mdash; many members of which argue for Hong Kong&#8217;s independence from China &mdash; staged a rally in the densely crowded Mong Kok district of central Kowloon to protest the presence of mainland Chinese street musicians. The performance of Mandarin-language songs in a Cantonese-speaking, working-class area like Mong Kok is regarded by many localists as culturally and politically provocative.<\/p>\n<p>Violent clashes broke out when pro-China groups showed up to counter the localists, with rival groups chasing each other through streets crowded with shoppers and tourists, forcing retail outlets to pull down their shutters. Police say five protesters, four men and one woman, were arrested. No injury figures have been released, but police used pepper spray to subdue protesters and local media published photos of at least one bloodied pro-China protester being led from the scene.<\/p>\n<p>Simon Sin, one of the leaders of Hong Kong Localism Power, accuses police of not doing enough to protect localist demonstrators. &#8220;The police protected the people who were attacking us. They didn&rsquo;t protect us. We got hurt yesterday,&#8221; Sin tells TIME.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>South China Morning Post<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/education-community\/article\/1829077\/police-use-pepper-spray-hong-kong-protesters\" target=\"_blank\">reported<\/a> that police were seen helping &#8220;apparent participants&#8221; in the street clashes to leave the area, angering localist groups and bearing uncomfortable echoes of last fall&#8217;s Umbrella Revolution, when student protesters occupying the Mong Kok streets accused police of not protecting them from thugs who tried to break up the demonstrations. Seven police officers who beat up a protester last November have also still not been brought to trial, despite the fact that the attack was filmed by a local TV news crew.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3939432\"><\/div>\n<p>The disturbances come ahead of a large protest march scheduled for July 1. The annual march &mdash; staged to coincide with the anniversary of Hong Kong&#8217;s return to Chinese sovereignty &mdash; covers an array of causes from LGBT rights to better conditions for migrant workers, but always has a strong pro-democratic focus. Sunday&#8217;s street battles also come after the recent failure of the Hong Kong government&#8217;s electoral proposals, which were designed to lay out a framework for the election of the city&rsquo;s next leader in 2017 but ended up underscoring the vast political gulf between democratic and pro-Chinese camps.<\/p>\n<p>In what appeared to be a separate incident, democracy activist and student leader Joshua Wong&mdash; named one of TIME&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3486048\/most-influential-teens-2014\/\">most influential teens<\/a> in 2014 &mdash; was attacked after leaving a cinema in Kowloon with his girlfriend.<\/p>\n<p>A man &ldquo;grabbed my neck, and punched my left eye. My glasses flew off,&rdquo; Wong, who was not involved in the localist protests, posted on his Facebook page, alongside a picture of his injuries.<\/p>\n<p>He told TIME that the attack <span class=\"message_content\">showed &#8220;that there are serious safety concerns in the future&#8221; for activists like himself and said that he needed &#8220;to care more about my personal security.&#8221; <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"message_content\">&#8220;People feel dissatisfied with the central Chinese government with the failure to deliver universal suffrage. What we see is the escalating conflicts between localist groups and the Chinese presence in Hong Kong,&#8221; Maya Wang, a China researcher in the Asia division of Human Rights Watch, tells TIME. &#8220;I think that kind of animosity between localist groups and the pro-Beijing groups stems from deeper discontent [felt by] Hong Kong people [in] their relationship with the central Chinese government.&#8221;<br \/>\n<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3632739\"

class=\"p1\">A controversial proposal to allow Hong Kong citizens to directly elect the city&#8217;s political leader but only from a list of up to three candidates already screened by Beijing was voted down Thursday after 10 hours of debate.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Only eight lawmakers voted in support of the proposal after pro-democracy activists and politicians deemed it a betrayal on an earlier promise to grant the Chinese Special Administrative Region &#8220;universal suffrage.&#8221; A minimum of 47 of the 70 lawmakers were needed to vote in favor of the proposal.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I&rsquo;m sad, I&#8217;m disappointed, I don&rsquo;t know when democratization can be taken forward,&#8221; said Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, who favored the proposal.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Anticipating defeat, members of the pro-Beijing camp staged a surprise walkout, though due to an apparent miscommunication, it lacked the numbers to remove the necessary quorum of 30 lawmakers. In the end, 37 votes were counted.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">On the mainland, state-backed media blamed the defeat on &#8220;radicals.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">Opposition to the proposal prompted hundreds of thousands to take to the streets late last year for a civil-disobedience movement that became known as the Umbrella Revolution. Large swaths of this freewheeling financial hub were paralyzed for almost three months.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\">As a result of the proposal&#8217;s defeat, the existing method of electing the chief executive from an electoral college of 1,200 mainly pro-Beijing representatives should now remain in place for the next ballot, slated for 2017.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The defeated proposal, which supporters characterized as a significant step toward long-promised democracy and opponents call a false approximation of free elections, spurred debate from both sides lasting from Wednesday into Thursday. Following council protocol, each representative was allowed 15 minutes to make a statement, with arguments seeming to boil down to optimism vs. skepticism. Proponents said the reforms would be a first step in a longer process of democratization, while the opposition said they would instead lead to political stagnation and increased mainland involvement in Hong Kong politics.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Legislators Fernando Cheung and Lam Cheuk-ting both said Tuesday that they would vote against the proposal. &ldquo;This is not a genuine free choice,&rdquo; Cheung told TIME. Lam agreed, calling the reforms a screening system for the opposition and saying they are &ldquo;totally unacceptable&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;ridiculous and shameful.&rdquo; Both lawmakers expressed concern that passing the reforms would provide the central government with plausible deniability in the promised movement toward democracy and prevent any further measures toward what they see as truly free elections.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"1\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4298933453001-1\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1QDsxs4\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4298933453001\"><\/object><\/div><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">But lawmaker Regina Ip told TIME on Wednesday she would urge her colleagues to vote in favor of the reform bill. &ldquo;This is a giant step forward&rdquo; for democracy, she said. &ldquo;Universal suffrage is by definition a universal right to vote, and Beijing is giving us just that.&rdquo; <\/span><\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3923968\"><\/div>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Outside the legislative complex, in a large square divided carefully by a barrier, protesters from both sides gathered to show support for their respective causes. An organization called Citizens Against Pseudo-Universal Suffrage had organized successive evenings of discussion with intellectuals and activists in the run-up to the vote, while next door groups like the Hong Kong United Youth Association, many of whom sported matching hats and shirts, chanted slogans in support of the central government.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">&ldquo;The key is about law and order in Hong Kong. It has been degenerating for a few years because of a small minority in town holding a different opinion,&#8221; Gary Sum, who works in the banking sector, told TIME outside the legislative complex on Wednesday as around him people waved Chinese flags and sang traditional songs. &#8220;We should have more respect for China because we are part of the sovereign state.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">On the other side of the square, at the competing antireform rally, Edmund Choi expressed incredulity at the opinions across the barrier, saying that such reforms would not do real good for the city. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why they come here, because if they love Hong Kong what they should do is agree with us,&#8221; he said. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Hong Kong police cited rumors that some protesters might storm the chamber during or after the vote as the cause of an increase in security at the complex, including 200 police in the chamber itself and more than 1,000 outside the complex, the <i>South China Morning<\/i> <i>Post<\/i> reported Wednesday. Tensions were running especially high after the arrest of 10 individuals in an alleged bomb plot on Monday, and Twitter users posted photos of police searching the bags of passengers in Admiralty, a nearby subway station, but no such actions ultimately took place. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">In addition, Cheung and Lam said that general security had been increased the week before the vote, including a curtailed number of assistants allowed to travel with each representative. Lam, who found such security to be unnecessary, called it a &ldquo;humiliation&rdquo; for the assistants, some of whom have worked in the building for decades. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s unreasonable and disproportionate,&rdquo; he said.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Although polls showed a nearly even split within Hong Kong on the matter, the reforms were ultimately voted down in a dramatic scene involving pro-reform representatives calling for a recess and then leaving without a vote.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Cheung saw the no vote as a larger statement about the limits of mainland power. &ldquo;The next move is to look at how civil society can gather our momentum again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a historic vote that signifies Hong Kong being able to say no to Beijing: that even as strong, as controlling, as economically, politically, militarily dominating as China is, we as a city are able to stand up and say no.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p

They were <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3920842\/hong-kong-activists-explosives-arrested\/\">arrested on<\/a> Sunday after police discovered what they described as chemicals for the making of bombs in an abandoned TV studio lot on the outskirts of Hong Kong.<\/p>\n<p>The <em>South China Morning Post<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/law-crime\/article\/1823125\/five-hong-kong-bomb-plot-suspects-denied-bail-legco-debates\">named<\/a> the suspects as Chan Yiu-shing, Cheng Wai-shing, Rizzy Pennelli, Wu Kai-fu and Man Ting-lock. Another suspect, Sarene Chan, was granted bail even though she faced the same charges, the <em>Post<\/em> said.<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong police have suggested that the suspects were a separatist cell intent on launching bomb attacks on targets in the city&#8217;s downtown areas. However, many in Hong Kong&#8217;s democratic movement believe the plot to be <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3922358\/hong-kong-separatist-localist-bombs-democracy-national-independent-party-propaganda\/\">a fabrication and a smear campaign<\/a> against those demanding greater political freedoms for the territory.<\/p>\n<p>The group&#8217;s court appearance came on the same day that lawmakers debated political reforms that <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3918681\/hong-kong-protest-democracy-umbrella-revolution-occupy\/\">sparked protests this weekend<\/a> and during last fall&#8217;s Umbrella Revolution. Under discussion is a bill would allow voters to directly elect Hong Kong&#8217;s leader, known as the chief executive, but only from a pool of candidates screened by Beijing and a 1,200-member election committee comprising mostly establishment figures. The bill is not expected to pass.<\/p>\n<p>Court has been adjourned until the middle of July pending analysis of chemicals and other items seized at the site.<\/p>\n<p>According to the <em>Post<\/em>, four more of those arrested were released on bail yesterday and have yet to be charged. They were told to report back to police in mid-July as investigations continue.<\/p>\n<p>[<em><a

bill.<\/p>\n<p>Joshua Wong, who played a leading role in last fall&#8217;s Umbrella Revolution, tells TIME that police claims to have uncovered a separatist cell intent on setting off explosives are <span class=\"message_content\">&ldquo;<\/span>one of the plans or the agenda by the pro-government side &mdash; it&rsquo;s propaganda to attack the &#8230; democrats.<span

they suggest were intended for detonation in the city&#8217;s Admiralty district. Admiralty is the seat of government, home to the legislature, the headquarters of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army and the office of the city&#8217;s highest-ranking official, known as the chief executive.<\/p>\n<p>A police media spokesman refused to divulge the political affiliations of those arrested, but a local newspaper, the <em>South China Morning Post<\/em>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/politics\/article\/1822636\/bomb-plot-rattles-nerves-across-hong-kong-lawmakers-play\" target=\"_blank\">citing an anonymous police source<\/a>, claimed that at least one of the detained individuals had <span class=\"message_content\">&ldquo;<\/span>affiliations<span class=\"message_content\">&rdquo;<\/span> to a separatist, so-called National Independent Party.<\/p>\n<p>Another local newspaper <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thestandard.com.hk\/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=158051&amp;sid=44670505&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20150616\" target=\"_blank\">claimed<\/a> that the party had posted on a now deleted Facebook page its determination to stop the passage of the political reform bill <span class=\"message_content\">&ldquo;<\/span>at any cost.<span class=\"message_content\">&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Separatist &mdash; or, to use the Hong Kong term, localist &mdash; politics are beginning to take root in the city as Hong Kongers feel a growing cultural, linguistic and political gap with mainland China.<\/p>\n<p>However, the fact that the organization was hitherto unknown has aroused suspicions. <span class=\"message_content\">&ldquo;<\/span><span class=\"message_content\">It doesn&#8217;t seem like a lot of these [separatist] organizations are very familiar with them, and some even feel that this organization seems to have a very suspicious background,&rdquo; Professor Eliza Lee, head of the Politics and Public Administration Department at Hong Kong University, told TIME.<\/span><\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3922358\"><\/div>\n<p>Jon Ho of separatist group Hong Kong Localism Power, told a local radio station Tuesday that the legitimacy of the <span class=\"message_content\">&ldquo;<\/span>National Independent Party<span class=\"message_content\">&rdquo; was questionable, the <em>Post<\/em> reported.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Some Hong Kongers on social media pointed out linguistic inconsistencies between the language of propaganda material police claim to have seized from the <span class=\"message_content\">&ldquo;<\/span>National Independent Party<span class=\"message_content\">&rdquo; and words that would have actually been used by bona fide separatist groups, while others pointedly asked why a separatist group would have the word <em>National<\/em><span class=\"message_content\"> in its name.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>Other separatist figures stressed their commitment to nonviolence. Ray Wong, leader of separatist group Hong Kong Indigenous, told the <em>Post<\/em> that the arrests were a smear campaign, while Danny Chan, head of the separatist Hong Kong Blue Righteous Revolt, said he did not support violence.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"message_content\">&ldquo;It would be unfair to say that the localists have a stronger tendency to be violent, and in fact if you look at the [pro-democracy] movement as a whole it was rather peaceful,&rdquo;

men and four women have been arrested in Hong Kong after police discovered what they say is highly explosive material in an abandoned TV studio on the outskirts of the city.<\/p>\n<p>Authorities claim that the group was planning some sort of attack ahead of this week&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3918681\/hong-kong-protest-democracy-umbrella-revolution-occupy\/\" target=\"_blank\">crucial vote on political reform<\/a> in the Hong Kong legislature, the <em>South China Morning Post<\/em> <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/law-crime\/article\/1822142\/suspected-explosive-devices-found-abandoned-atv-studio-sai\" target=\"_blank\">reports<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The paper described those arrested as &#8220;radical activists&#8221;&mdash;among them a student, a construction worker and a teaching assistant&mdash;and quoted an unnamed police source as saying they were part of a Hong Kong separatist organization that had already discussed online plans to detonate a bomb.<\/p>\n<p>At a press conference Monday afternoon local time, police declined to cite the name of the organization for what were described as &#8220;operational&#8221; reasons. However, a Superintendent Ng confirmed that officers had found &ldquo;several kilograms of solid substance and five liters of liquid substance we believe to be chemicals linked to [the making of] explosives.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Police also found at another location three bottles of the &ldquo;major raw material&rdquo; for the making of the explosive <span class=\"st\">triacetone triperoxide<\/span> (TATP). TATP has been used in several terrorist attacks, notably the London bombings of 2005 in which 52 died and hundreds were injured.<\/p>\n<p>Along with the alleged explosives, authorities claim to have found maps showing locations in the city&#8217;s Admiralty district, which is home to the legislature, the headquarters of the People&#8217;s Liberation Army and the office of the highest official in the Hong Kong government, known as the Chief Executive. Locations in the neighboring district of Wanchai&mdash;a diverse area where luxury hotels and offices can be found as well as the city&#8217;s red light strip&mdash;were also allegedly marked.<\/p>\n<p>A police spokesman told the press conference that there were &#8220;possibilities&#8221; that the suspected radicals were planning to &#8220;do something&#8221; at those locations.<\/p>\n<p>Political tension has remained high in Hong Kong since last fall&#8217;s pro-democracy Umbrella Revolution. The city is sharply divided between those who advocate political conciliation with China and those who want Hong Kong to be run under fully democratic lines with almost total autonomy from Beijing.<\/p>\n<p>[<em><a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/law-crime\/article\/1822142\/suspected-explosive-devices-found-abandoned-atv-studio-sai\" target=\"_blank\">SCMP<\/a><\/em>]<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3632739\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world politics, diplomacy, conflict, culture, humanitarian disasters, religion and much more","world":true},"topic":{"name":"Hong Kong","slug":"hong-kong","left_rail_title":"Hong Kong","left_rail_subhead":"More Hong Kong Coverage","editor_content":"","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/topic\/hong-kong\/","email_title":"Hong%20Kong | TIME","email_body":"Hong%20Kong%0A%0Ahttp%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2Ftopic%2Fhong-kong%2F","encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F%2F3981644%2Fhong-kong-breast-assault-protest%2F","encoded_shortlink":"","twitter_text":"","encoded_title":"Hong%20Kong","is_vault":false},"tag":{"name":"Hong Kong","slug":"hong-kong","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/topic\/hong-kong\/"},"tags":"Hong Kong|Hong Kong explosives|Legco|Legco reform bill|Sai Kung|Umbrella Revolution|universal suffrage","id":3920842,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3920842%2Fhong-kong-activists-explosives-arrested%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1Tn0sUK","encoded_title":"Nine+Hong+Kong+%E2%80%98Activists%E2%80%99+Arrested+After+Police+Discover+Explosives","galleries":[{"id":3632739,"slug":"hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-photos","title":"79 Days That Shook Hong Kong","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3632739\/hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-photos\/","type":"normal","hidecount":false,"fullscreen":true,"counterfullscreen":true,"adfrequency":0,"encoded_url":"http%3A%2F%2Ftime.com%2F3632739%2Fhong-kong-umbrella-revolution-photos%2F","encoded_shortlink":"http%3A%2F%2Fti.me%2F1AMiYbY","encoded_title":"79+Days+That+Shook+Hong+Kong","twitter_via":"TIMEWorld","email_title":"79%20Days%20That%20Shook%20Hong%20Kong","hasAds":false,"twitter_text":"See%20unforgettable%20images%20from%20Hong%20Kong%27s%2079%20days%20of%20street%20protests","fb_text":"See%20unforgettable%20images%20from%20Hong%20Kong%27s%2079%20days%20of%20street%20protests","email_body":"Hong%20Kong%27s%20street%20occupations%20have%20ended%2C%20but%20many%20demonstrators%20say%20this%20is%20only%20the%20beginning%20of%20their%20fight%20for%20free%20elections","size":"default","galleries":[{"id":4004889,"title":"How a Photographer Captured the USSR's Dramatic Rise as the U.S. Economy Tanked","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/150820-russia-1931-05.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/4004889\/soviet-union-margaret-bourke-white\/"},{"id":4008994,"title":"On the Set of China\u2019s Latest War Films","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/china-war-film-industry-5.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/4008994\/china-war-film-industry\/"},{"id":3996328,"title":"See the Best Photos From an Astronaut's Fifth Month in Space","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/scott-kelly-photograph-iss-5th-month01.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/3996328\/scott-kelly-space-photos-fifth-month\/"},{"id":4003737,"title":"Inside Kobani and the Kurdish War Against ISIS","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/mel2015000g0808-2821.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/4003737\/kobani-isis-photos\/"},{"id":4010034,"title":"Heartbreaking Photos of Syrian Refugees and Their Newborns","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/syrian-refugee-mothers-jordan-8.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/4010034\/syrian-refugee-mothers-jordan\/"},{"id":4007349,"title":"These Photos Show the Reality of Spain's Housing Crisis","image":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/spain-evictions-3.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550&h=367&crop=1","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/4007349\/spain-evictions-housing-crisis\/"}],"photos":[{"id":3632767,"title":"HONG KONG-CHINA-POLITICS-DEMOCRACY","slug":"hong-kong-china-politics-democracy-47","caption":"Pro-democracy demonstrators are sprayed with pepper spray during clashes with police officers during a rally near the Hong Kong government headquarters on Sept. 28, 2014.

workers and families as well as students and democracy activists &mdash; marched on Sunday afternoon from Victoria Park, a traditional gathering place for protests, to the legislature buildings downtown. Many carried yellow umbrellas &mdash; adopted as the symbol of Hong Kong&#8217;s democracy movement after protesters took to carrying them during last year&#8217;s unrest to protect themselves from police pepper spray.<\/p>\n<p>Others carried signs that read &#8220;Citizens Against Pseudo-Universal Suffrage,&#8221; declaring their opposition to the form of democracy described in a political reform bill to be voted on by the city&#8217;s legislature on June 17. That bill will allow the central government in Beijing, and a 1,200-member electoral college composed mostly of proestablishment figures, to vet all candidates for the position of chief executive, as the city&#8217;s top official is known. Similarly unrepresentative electoral methods helped to spark last fall&rsquo;s Umbrella Revolution, and protesters are once again demanding broader political rights.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not North Korea, we know what freedom is,&#8221; said Carol Lo, 35, a protester at Sunday&#8217;s rally and a parent of a 9-year-old girl. Lo voiced fears for the political future of Hong Kong&#8217;s next generation: &#8220;How will [my daughter] survive, if this situation gets worse and worse?&#8221; she said.<\/p>\n<p>Another protester, Uber driver Chao Sang, voiced the growing tendency of many Hong Kongers to see themselves as politically, linguistically and culturally separate from mainland Chinese. &#8220;I&#8217;m a genuine citizen of Hong Kong, I&#8217;m not from China,&#8221; he told TIME. &#8220;Most people from China are after money, but I&#8217;m after truth.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Many in Hong Kong have fought for universal suffrage and full democracy since the former British colony came under China&rsquo;s control in 1997. These groups seek to protect Hong Kong&#8217;s status as China&#8217;s freest city.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3918681\"><\/div>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3632739\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>When the U.K. handed over power, Hong Kongers were promised a high degree of autonomy with the eventual goal of universal suffrage. Currently, however, Hong Kong voters only have the power to directly elect 35 of the 70 seats in the Legislative Council. The rest of the seats, so-called functional constituencies, are picked by an amalgamation of corporate interest and professional groups. Many Hong Kongers want the Legislative Council to consist entirely of directly elected members and for chief-executive candidates to be similarly nominated and elected by the city&#8217;s 3.2 million voters.<\/p>\n<p>During last fall&rsquo;s Umbrella Revolution, Hong Kongers showed defiant resistance to what they see as Beijing&rsquo;s desire to control the government. Many protesters feel that, by preselecting the nominees for chief executive, Beijing and the council were denying Hong Kongers a truly transparent and free election process.<\/p>\n<p>Identical defiance lies behind Sunday&#8217;s rally, although <a href=\"http:\/\/www.scmp.com\/news\/hong-kong\/politics\/article\/1820291\/beijing-still-eager-get-2017-reform-proposal-passed\">according to a poll<\/a> carried out by three Hong Kong universities, public support for the reform package is split down the middle, with 43% against and 41.7% in favor.<\/p>\n<p>The no-vote should carry the day as, without the support of democratic legislators, the bill has little chance of passing. Many activists nonetheless plan to come onto the streets between now and Wednesday&#8217;s vote to keep up the pressure.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Our plan is good and it&#8217;s working,&#8221; protester Ivy Cheung, 30, told TIME. &#8220;You have to come here, to the heart of government.

it does on every June 4, Hong Kong&#8217;s Victoria Park turned into a sea of humanity Thursday night local time as people gathered for a candlelight vigil in remembrance of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, when hundreds, if not thousands, of youngsters demanding democracy were killed by the Chinese army.<\/p>\n<p>People began pouring in to the large public park in Hong Kong&#8217;s downtown Causeway Bay district by 6 p.m., two hours before the sweltering vigil officially began, and continued to arrive well after it started. Volunteers from various political parties and civil-society groups lined the approach, addressing the crowd through loudhailers, attempting to raise funds and &mdash; this being pragmatic, capitalist Hong Kong &mdash; selling fans and small folding chairs.<\/p>\n<p>The 25th anniversary of the massacre last year saw an estimated 180,000 attendees. This year&#8217;s crowd was also impressive, with the six adjacent soccer fields at the park&#8217;s center quickly filling up, forcing thousands of late arrivals to be accommodated on grassy expanses elsewhere in the park. The organizers estimated the final attendance at around 135,000. (The Hong Kong police, notorious for the conservatism of their crowd estimates, put the crowd at just over 46,000.)<\/p>\n<p>Several hard-line democracy groups and student unions <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3908551\/tiananmen-massacre-june-4-1989-hong-kong-vigil-hkfs\/\" target=\"_blank\">chose to give the vigil a miss<\/a> and organized their own events to observe the 26th anniversary of the bloody crackdown in Beijing. Many young people do not agree with the call, made each year by the organizers of the main vigil, for a unified democratic China. Instead, they feel linguistically, culturally, and historically alienated from mainland China and argue that Hong Kong&#8217;s own <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3453736\/hong-kong-stands-up\/\" target=\"_blank\">struggle for democracy<\/a> &mdash; which flared up during last year&#8217;s Umbrella Revolution, when thousands occupied the streets for over three months &mdash; should take precedence over trying to reform China&#8217;s communist government.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;People may have different views on organizing it &mdash; maybe they think this is not the way that they should pay tribute,&#8221; Mak Hoi-wah, vice chairman of the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, which organizes the event, told TIME on the eve of the vigil. &#8220;They are free to do so. We are not expecting everybody to do it in the same way, but don&#8217;t forget June 4.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>A parallel vigil organized by the Hong Kong University Students&#8217; Union at their campus drew around 2,000 people, and the hosts were quoted as saying there would be &#8220;no singing, no sales and no applause for ourselves.&#8221; Although the students did observe a minute&#8217;s silence for the Tiananmen dead, the conversation was directed more toward Hong Kong&#8217;s and Taiwan&#8217;s struggle against a common oppressor &mdash; the communist government in Beijing.<\/p>\n<p>Hundreds more gathered across the harbor in Kowloon&#8217;s Tsim Sha Tsui district, for a more adversarial rally organized by Civic Passion, an organization that demands Hong Kong be given the same degree of autonomy as a city-state. The crowd shouted slogans against the Communist Party, and burned the party&#8217;s flag as they have been doing for the past two years.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3908678\"><\/div>\n<p>Both rallies paled, however, in comparison to the massive turnout at Victoria Park, where a peaceful and somber crowd held candles high in the air and observed a minute&#8217;s silence. As is customary, looming replicas of the Monument to the People&#8217;s Heroes &mdash; a tall obelisk in Tiananmen Square &mdash; and the Goddess of Democracy statue were paraded through the crowd, with wreaths being laid at their bases to commemorate the dead.<\/p>\n<p>Other elements of the ceremony paid tribute to the central symbol of the Umbrella Revolution, with posters depicting a candle shaped like a yellow umbrella, and several such umbrellas themselves, among the huge crowd. Representatives from the four students&#8217; unions that did choose to attend gave speeches denouncing the Chinese government&#8217;s handling of Hong Kong before burning a copy of the Basic Law &mdash; the name given to Hong Kong&#8217;s de facto constitution &mdash; on stage.<\/p>\n<p>Despite talk of a rift between younger and older generations, large numbers of attendees were college students and recent graduates, many of whom had chosen to join the vigil for the first time.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want Hong Kong to get worse,&#8221; said 22-year-old Pak Lam-wong, explaining that he decided to attend the annual gathering after last year&#8217;s pro-democracy protests. Pak also had another reason for attending. &#8220;If I have children one day, I want to tell them about this event,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I want to know more.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Another first-time attendee, a 19-year-old who said he was afraid to give his name after revealing that he hails from China&#8217;s Hebei province, lamented the lack of information and openness on the mainland. &#8220;I want to remember this: most people in China have forgotten this history,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are chasing the same goal as Hong Kong&#8217;s people &mdash; freedom, liberty and justice. China has really divided mainland China and Hong Kong people.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Hong Kong&#8217;s own tryst with democracy, meanwhile, is far from over. Two weeks from now, on June 17, the city&#8217;s legislature will vote on an electoral reform proposal that the pro-democracy legislators are expected to reject. If that happens, and the reform doesn&#8217;t pass, there are several possibilities for what happens next, one of which includes the <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3814943\/occupy-hong-kong-china-umbrella-revolution-democracy\/\" target=\"_blank\">resurgence of street protests<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>But on Thursday night it was all about remembering the pro-democracy crusaders who laid down their lives for the cause over two and a half decades ago. Many in Hong Kong pray that they will not have to do the same.<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and

more than a quarter of a century, while China censored and suppressed all mention of the event, Hong Kong has defiantly commemorated the anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre that took place in Beijing on June 4, 1989, when soldiers brutally crushed a weeks-long pro-democracy protest. Ever since, tens of thousands of Hong Kong people have gathered for the <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/2823269\/watch-hong-kong-holds-candlelight-vigil-on-tiananmen-square-anniversary\/\" target=\"_blank\">annual candlelight vigil at the city&#8217;s central Victoria Park<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>This year, however, the normally sacrosanct unity represented by the vigil is being threatened because some of the student groups that have traditionally attended the event are deciding to opt out of it.<\/p>\n<p>Most prominent among those is the Hong Kong Federation of Students (HKFS), which announced in April that it would give this year&rsquo;s vigil a miss because many of its members do not believe in the demand for a democratic China that vigil organizers normally make. The reasons are partly to do with identity &mdash; many local students considers themselves to be Hong Kong people first and foremost, linguistically and culturally distinct from mainland Chinese. But there are also tactical considerations: many within the HKFS, one of the organizations at the forefront of the <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3453736\/hong-kong-stands-up\/\" target=\"_blank\">city&rsquo;s pro-democracy movement<\/a> last year, believe that they must focus on their own struggle for the right to elect the leader of this freewheeling, sophisticated city of just over 7 million mostly well-educated inhabitants.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Trying to build a democratic China without having democracy in Hong Kong is utterly unrealistic,&rdquo; Billy Fung, president of the Hong Kong University Students&rsquo; Union, <a href=\"http:\/\/sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com\/2015\/06\/03\/rival-pro-democracy-rallies-planned-for-june-4-in-hong-kong\/?smid=tw-share&amp;_r=0\">told<\/a> the New York <em>Times<\/em>. The student union, which recently followed several other universities in breaking away from HKFS, will organize its own gathering at the university campus on Thursday to &ldquo;discuss Hong Kong&rsquo;s future as Hong Kong people.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Unlike the brutal crackdown in Tiananmen Square that saw hundreds if not thousands of nonviolent Chinese protesters killed by the army, the tens of thousands of Hong Kong students and activists who occupied the streets for nearly three months last year were <a href=\"http:\/\/time.com\/3633269\/occupy-hong-kong-umbrella-revolution-causeway-bay\/\" target=\"_blank\">cleared peacefully<\/a> in mid-December. The political reform they were campaigning for &mdash; the right to nominate and directly elect candidates for the city&#8217;s top job &mdash; remains elusive, however. The city&#8217;s present chief executive, as the leader is called, is Leung Chun-ying, who assumed office after winning just 689 votes from members of tightly vetted electoral college of mostly pro-Beijing and establishment figures.<\/p>\n<div class=\"galleryContainer galleryContainer--embedded\" data-gallery=\"3632739\" data-size=\"default\"><\/div>\n<p>&ldquo;The students find it difficult to realize the slogan of the organizers &mdash; &lsquo;To promote democracy movement in China,&rsquo;&rdquo; Ho Pui-yin, a professor of modern Chinese history at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK), tells TIME. &ldquo;If they promote the democracy movement, they want to concentrate on Hong Kong.&rdquo;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-3908551\"><\/div>\n<p>Student groups are not the only ones boycotting the event in Victoria Park. Another vigil is being organized by a group called Civic Passion set to take place across the harbor on the Kowloon peninsula. This parallel event, which began in 2013, is part of a growing &ldquo;localism&rdquo; movement that calls for a more radical separation between Hong Kong and China. Another group, called Localism Power, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.thestandard.com.hk\/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=30&amp;art_id=157518&amp;sid=44580059&amp;con_type=1\">disrupted<\/a> the annual Tiananmen commemorative march on Sunday, the <em>Standard<\/em> reported, with about 20 members of the group engaging in verbal altercations with the marchers.<\/p>\n<p>The organizers of the Victoria Park vigil, a collective of several civil-society groups called the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements in China, are doing everything they can to stress that the schism between Hong Kong&rsquo;s struggle for democracy and China&rsquo;s is unnecessary.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;They are not against each other, we should be working together,&rdquo; said Mak Hoi-wah, vice chairman of the alliance, speaking to TIME Wednesday night while supervising the setup for the event at Victoria Park. Nearby, a group of volunteers unfurled a large banner depicting a candle in the shape of a yellow umbrella &mdash; the symbol of Hong Kong&rsquo;s pro-democracy protests last year.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;The young people want immediate solutions to problems because they&rsquo;re frustrated and angry, they resent the government&rsquo;s measures in Hong Kong as well as China,&rdquo; Mak said, adding that these feelings could be what have now prompted them to shun the peaceful and symbolic gathering at Victoria Park. &ldquo;But we do think that is very important because more than 150,000 people are coming to Victoria Park every year. We stand firm together to show our solidarity and to hold people accountable, this is the way we show our muscle and show our power.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>For Professor Ho of CUHK, the very thing that sets Hong Kong apart from China is what makes commemorating Tiananmen here so important.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;It shows that &lsquo;one country, two systems&rsquo; is still working, because this is the only city in China that can commemorate the June 4 incident,&rdquo; she says, referring to the principle under which Hong Kong is allowed greater economic and social liberties despite under the sovereignty of communist China. &ldquo;The main difference is that we have freedom of speech, so this shows to the world that Hong Kong is different from the mainland.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper
