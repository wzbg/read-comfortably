Those two scenes aired back-to-back perfectly encapsulate the tone of the show: responsibility vs. publicity. Activism vs. fame. Education vs. entertainment.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>To many, these may seem like dichotomies or ambitions that are at odds with each other. But <i>I Am Cait </i>proves how, in this era of celebrity culture and near-suffocating influence of the rich and famous, the marriage of these opposing forces may help this series, if it&#x2019;s a hit, become a landmark entity in the LGBT movement.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>The entire premiere undulates between the lighthearted and the sometimes unbearably heavy (not in an off-putting way, but in a very real, imperative way).</p> </div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Kim Kardashian calls Caitlyn on the day of her <i>Vanity Fair</i> debut. Her first words: &#x201C;You didn&#x2019;t tell me you were on Twitter!&#x201D; The laughs are quickly escorted out by an ominous music cue. &#x201C;You also have to realize that it&#x2019;s not this way for everybody,&#x201D; Jenner says, tempering the celebration.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>It&#x2019;s a shrewd acknowledgment of what many critics have called Jenner&#x2019;s privilege problem. She&#x2019;s addressing the reality that not every transgender person can afford the surgeries, the protection, or the support that she&#x2019;s been afforded. She&#x2019;s addressing the horrific statistics about suicide, depression, and violence plaguing the transgender community.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>To ensure awareness that Jenner&#x2019;s transgender story is not universal, E! has brought on a trio of well-regarded transgender consultants to make sure that these crucial messages are conveyed in the right way.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Because of all this, sometimes <i>I Am Cait</i> can veer into Afterschool Special territory, but it&#x2019;s saved by the warmth, authenticity, and gut-busting quick wit and humor of the show&#x2019;s breakout stars: Caitlyn Jenner&#x2019;s non-famous family members.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>The centerpiece of the show&#x2019;s premiere is Caitlyn&#x2019;s debut in front of her sisters, Lisa and Pam, and her mother, Esther, an angel of a woman brimming with love and&#x2014;perhaps as an unintentional public service&#x2014;questions about her son&#x2019;s transition. Her confusion is no match, however, for her desire to accept her child and cherish their evolving relationship.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Esther is the breakout star of the show. If there&#x2019;s any good in the world, she&#x2019;s also the person who might be the biggest factor in changing the minds of Americans who tune in unsure of what to think about the transgender community.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>&#x201C;It&#x2019;s OK,&#x201D; Caitlyn tells her family when they walk in and see her as <i>her</i> for the first time. &#x201C;I knew it would be,&#x201D; Esther says, giving her child a hug. &#x201C;Gorgeous,&#x201D; Pam says, through tears. &#x201C;I thought you were going to look more like me,&#x201D; she laughs.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Like E!&#x2019;s special <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/17/about-bruce-how-bruce-jenner-s-transition-made-the-kardashians-unexpected-role-models.html"><i>About Bruce</i></a><a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/05/17/about-bruce-how-bruce-jenner-s-transition-made-the-kardashians-unexpected-role-models.html"> episodes</a> of <i>Keeping Up With the Kardashians</i>, it&#x2019;s not all painted as saintly acceptance. Caitlyn Jenner admits to worrying that her family&#x2019;s loving response is just for the cameras. And when her family returns to their lives, they sit shell-shocked over what is happening to the Bruce they once knew.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>Esther tells Caitlyn, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s going to be so difficult to call you &#x2018;she,&#x2019; or think of you as Caitlyn.&#x201D; But it&#x2019;s her tear-soaked sentiment near the end of the episode that crystallizes the whole point of the show.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>She remembers watching her son, Bruce, be crowned an Olympic gold medalist. And she ponders her daughter, Caitlyn. &#x201C;I am more proud of him for the courage that he has shown,&#x201D; she says, comparing Caitlyn&#x2019;s present struggles to her athletic triumphs. &#x201C;I loved him with all my heart and I certainly love her with all my heart.&#x201D;</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>There are many tears, and the premiere takes its time earning them. Perhaps predictably, it&#x2019;s a tad bloated. There&#x2019;s a slight, though amusing, appearance from Kim and Kanye West that may be one of the funniest scenes of the summer TV season. In a touching bookend to her role in <i>About Bruce</i>, Kim revisits Caitlyn&#x2019;s closet now that she&#x2019;s living life as a woman and re-adjudicates her wardrobe.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>And indicating what form the show might take going forward, Jenner visits Katharine Prescott, the mother of Kyler, a transgender teen who <a href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/transgender/2015/05/25/san-diego-mourns-third-trans-teen-die-suicide">recently killed himself</a>.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>So much of that sequence is illuminating, from the three cars Jenner must take to escape the paparazzi on her way to the Prescotts&#x2019; to the surprising revelation from Mrs. Prescott that her son was embraced by his parents and that his suicide came from bullying, his inner turmoil, and adults&#x2019; refusal to accept his transition.</p> </div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>The show ends with a title card featuring the number to the Trevor Project suicide hotline, and a plea for anyone having suicidal thoughts to reach out.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>A quick trailer for the remainder of the eight-episode season then plays, showing Jenner navigating how to live publicly as Caitlyn and discuss her transition with the press, while still being respectful to her family. It shows her being educated by other members of the transgender community on their own struggles.</p></div><div class="text wrapper" data-resourcetype="mobilebeast2/components/text"><p>It shows a woman realizing that she&#x2019;s carrying the weight of <i>a </i>world, of <i>a </i>movement, on her shoulders, and the reality that she may actually have the power to change it for the better. </p></div></section><footer><div class="amazon-btn" style="display:none; position: relative;"><div class="amazon-btn-icon"><img src="/etc/clientlibs/dailybeast2/img/amzn_favicon_blk.png"></div><div class="amazon-btn-title">Shop &#x25BE;</div><div class="amazon-btn-placement" data-content-path="/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/07/22/i-am-cait-review-reality-tv-has-never-been-this-essential-or-this-good" data-tracking-id="thedailybeast-entertainment-20"></div></div><ul class="sharetools"><li class="sharetool facebook"><a class="icon-facebook facebook-popup" aria-hidden="true" data-link="http://thebea.st/1gOXcCE" data-picture="http://cdn.thedailybeast.com/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/07/22/i-am-cait-review-reality-tv-has-never-been-this-essential-or-this-good/jcr:content/image.img.200.jpg/1437617495534.cached.jpg" data-name="&amp;lsquo;I Am Cait&amp;rsquo; Review: Reality TV Has Never Been This Essential Or This Good" data-description="Forget worries that Caitlyn Jenner&amp;rsquo;s reality show would be a vapid &amp;lsquo;Kardashians&amp;rsquo; retread.

Fake just like a woman.” The Rolling Stones sang about everything from slave rape (“Brown Sugar”) to statutory rape (“Stray Cat Blues”) to rape and murder (“Midnight Rambler”) with a bawdy carelessness that likely wouldn’t be tolerated today. Even earlier Rolling Stones hits like “Under My Thumb” wallow in sexism as frontman Mick Jagger sings about getting a strong-willed woman to submit: “It’s down to me—the way she talks when she’s spoken to. It’s down to me. The change has come. She’s under my thumb.” In “I’ve Got A Woman,” an exuberant Ray Charles sang that his lady “never goes out and leaving me alone.

It shouldn’t be news that rappers of the ‘80s and ‘90s could often be unapologetically misogynistic. Slick Rick is one of the wittiest rappers to ever grab a mic and arguably the genre’s greatest storyteller. But his music was consistently misogynistic and borderline hateful towards women, as revealed on songs like the self-explanatory “Treat Her Like A Prostitute” and “A Love That’s True,” which opens with Rick advising a youngster, “You don’t trust no bitch, OK?” Eightball and MJG gleefully rapped about physically abusing women on songs like “Pimps” and “Lay It Down.” And from the moment he broke through in 1999, Eminem has achieved multiplatinum success with dark tales about murdering the women in his life—from his ex-wife to his own mother.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/pullquote","quote":"We have to be honest about all that hip-hop is if we believe that hip-hop can change.","quotePath":"/content/dailybeast/articles/2015/08/29/atoning-for-hip-hop-s-history-of-misogyny-from-dr-dre-to-kanye-west.html","quoteName":"pullquote"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eBut this is a kinder, gentler age of mainstream rap music—right?

Drake is the poster boy for the sensitive Millennial rapper, but he regularly presents women as either lost children to be saved or shallow dream chasers looking to exploit rich and famous men. The approach has shifted from the kind of “Bitches Ain’t Shit” anthems that made gangsta rap so controversial to more supposedly “benevolent” diatribes about women who supposedly lack direction.

He goes on to mention how the local bakery stocks a loaf called the SS loaf, named after the shop, “but that’s a loaf we never buy.” One winter’s day some children throw snowballs at their kitchen window and yell “Jews!” His mother’s face turns ashen—“Utterly white and utterly silent.” He is unsure of the meaning of the word, but “knows it has something to do with the shadows.”\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Brief Stop on the Road from Auschwitz\u003c/i\u003e touches upon Rosenberg’s childhood and blossoming self-awareness in postwar Sweden, but essentially it is his telling of his father’s story, one that chronicles the struggle to survive the Holocaust and then the struggle to live with the aftershock. The key word in the book’s title—other than its ugly last one—is “from.” For Rosenberg’s father, David, belonged to that rare minority that didn’t only go “to” Auschwitz; miraculously for him, the camp was a transit point not a final destination. He lived to tell his tale—except he didn’t, not openly, and certainly not to his son. And so drawing on the letters between his parents during their years of separation, along with trawling records and tracing routes, Rosenberg charts his father’s journey from his native Poland to his adoptive Sweden. The road to Auschwitz, he explains, is “a collective hell shared by each and every one.” The less-traveled road from Auschwitz, he discovers, “follows the most shifting routes, veers off to the most unpredictable destinations, and comes through the most unexpected places.”\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eThus Rosenberg rewinds from Södertälje in 1947 to the Łódź ghetto in 1942.

His journey’s end was not quite the Promised Land he envisaged and he battled to stay afloat. It is not only his private memories that grind him down. Postwar Sweden, particularly its provincial backwaters, views the incoming stateless survivors with suspicion. “We are not used to dealing with people so alien to Swedish attitudes and standards,” the local newspaper declares. Astonishingly, the authorities categorize them as “former concentration camp clients.” That suspicion sours into downright distrust when, in the 1950s, David Rosenberg is examined by a German doctor with a view to claiming compensation for Nazi persecution. He is told that he is ill because he wants reparations, not because he has survived Auschwitz. His claim is rejected and he receives nothing.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eCumulatively, these hard knocks take their toll. The finishing touches Rosenberg makes to the portrait of his father are the darkest of dabs. The result is a chiaroscuro composed of more shade than light but one that manages to be all the more revealing because of it. Rosenberg floors us with a shock conclusion and provides us with a wealth of insight on the way to it. I thought my German \u003ci\u003eWortschatz\u003c/i\u003e was pretty ample but one terrible word that Rosenberg cites and one that is mercifully absent from modern dictionaries and common parlance is \u003ci\u003eEntjudung\u003c/i\u003e—“dejudification.” One of the book’s enduring images is of the residents of the town of Ludwigslust ordered by American troops to witness the atrocities committed at the nearby camp of Wöbbelin. We get this visually and on a larger scale in \u003ci\u003eNight Will Fall\u003c/i\u003e after the liberation of Dachau: American soldiers bringing in Germans from neighboring Weimar who had been willing to make use of the cheap labor of the camp—“as long as they were beyond smelling range of it.” Rosenberg’s account of Wöbbelin feels like a thumbnail sketch in comparison, but it comes clad with rich detail and accompanied by righteous ire: “the blatant lie” of “we knew nothing and could do nothing.” Both film and book show how flimsy these pleas of mitigation were and the measures the Allies took to refocus blind eyes, impose culpability and ensure that certain images once seen would never be forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eAt the height of the killing, when one overloaded transport after another hurtled towards the camps and the crematoria and fire pits were continually aflame—when the annihilation was relentless—the Nazis left scant possibility for victims to become testifying survivors.

(Primo Levi also identified with the Ancient Mariner and used a quote from Coleridge’s poem—“…till my ghastly tale is told”—for the epitaph of his final collection of essays, \u003ci\u003eThe Drowned and the Saved\u003c/i\u003e.) Arrested by the Gestapo for Communist agitation and propaganda, Heiner is interrogated and tortured and then sent on to Auschwitz, that “playground of murder in Poland.” Like David Rosenberg he escapes selection for the gas chamber but is put to work and turned into “a striped skeleton.” However, instead of physical, back-breaking toil he has the mentally arduous duty of typing up death notices all day. He buckles under the psychological strain of watching and recording wholesale murder, but steels himself and utilizes his function by memorizing each crime on the off-chance that he can survive and be called upon as a reliable witness.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eSurvive he does, but when he is summoned in 1964 from Vienna to testify against 20 suspected war criminals in Frankfurt, the prospect of reliving a nightmare causes him to crumple and clam up. Two men in particular make him quake: Kaduk, who beat prisoners with a club, and Klehr, who injected “patients” with a phenol-filled syringe. Lena, the court translator, encourages him to be strong in words that evoke “shipwrecked” David Rosenberg: “Do you know what a wreck is?” she asks him. “A wreck is a ‘drifting object’ that has become unusable due to decay or damage. Decay certainly doesn’t apply to you.”\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eAs if to prove it, Lena falls for Heiner, and the pair settle down together and see to what degree love can heal trauma. To begin with it seems as if their 10-year age-gap will be the biggest stumbling block, but Lena comes to realize that Heiner is constantly haunted by his demons. This is a man who keeps a mustard jar full of ground bones from victims at Birkenau. For him it is no worse than living with yellowed photos of dead relatives: “Both are mementoes of people that don’t exist anymore.” And yet slowly she learns to understand his foibles, accommodate his pain and let him rant and wail whenever an innocuous occurrence triggers an appalling memory.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eHeld impresses with a segment that sees Heiner and Lena visiting Poland in the 1980s. The country is under martial law and Heiner’s old Polish Resistance friends are still fighting for democratic change but this time as supporters of Solidarity. The crux of the trip is a return to Auschwitz, “the world’s biggest graveyard,” where Heiner can confront his past and test the limits of Lena’s comprehension. Held intercalates Heiner’s pilgrimage and the flashbacks to his early years with snapshots of the consequences of his time in the camp: sleepless nights, ruined relationships, and an unassuaged urge to lose himself in Holocaust studies and impress on anyone within earshot anecdotes, images and tales. A fellow survivor asks Lena what it is like living with “one of us.” “What do you think it’s like?” she answers. “It’s like living with a singer who can’t stop singing the song of his life. He sings it in the morning, he sings it at noon and in the afternoon, evening, and night. It has many verses.

However, Held judiciously tempers the gloom by rotating perspectives and flitting backwards and forwards through time.
