It was in part this mix of qualities that enabled Ford and her husband Jerry to transform the modeling business and create a new caliber of fashion mannequin. As Lacey explains, “The title ‘Ford model’ carried a cache all its own. Ford models were seen as the aristocrats of their profession: thighs that stretched for miles, and expectation of blondeness, though not invariably so; and a general impression of extra sparkle, height and slenderness—stature, in every sense of the word, including mental discipline and punctuality.” \u003cbr /\u003e\r\n\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href\u003d\"http://wwd.com/eye/people/robert-lacey-eileen-ford-book-10150806/\" target\u003d\"_blank\"\u003eLacey\u003c/a\u003e, who claims a specialty in biographies of royals, handles his subject with good humor.

She was outgoing and ambitious, but not an intellectual. In high school, she planned dances for her sorority. (In 1938, the family name changed from Ottensoser to Otte, obscuring their Jewish roots. Astonishingly, Lacey says that they did so in order for Ford to avoid the \u0026quot;Jewish quota\u0026quot; when applying to college; she wasn\u0027t smart enough to compete for the slots reserved for Jews.) While attending college at Barnard she was banned from assemblies after attending a talk by Eleanor Roosevelt and laughing uproariously at her “strange” voice.

In 1944, after three months of courtship, Ford hopped a train to follow the unsuspecting naval ensign to San Francisco, leaving only a brief note to her parents. “I love him and there doesn’t seem to be much I can do about it except marry him,” she wrote, “so I’ve gone to do just that.” Although Jerry had no idea she was on her way, soon after her arrival they married at City Hall. He was 19. She was 22.

Ford Models opened in 1947, originally in partnership with Nickerson (a fact only uncovered as Lacey researched this book). In 1948, \u003ci\u003eLife\u003c/i\u003e magazine ran a spread featuring the “Family-style” agency, and put the business on the map. The Fords made a great team. “Eileen had the eye that recruited the quality, and Jerry made sure that people paid properly for it,” writes Lacey. (At the time, the highest paid model in the world was earning $40 an hour. By the 1990, Linda Evangelista famously quipped that “we don’t wake up for less than $10,000 a day.”) “Jerry introduced cancellation fees, fitting fees and weather permitting fees,” Lacey writes.

While not unchallenged, they were generally secure in their primacy. They grew their stable of models, their relationships with agencies around the globe and, most importantly, their reputation. This was important to Ford, who brought many of her models to live at the Ford townhouse on 78\u003csup\u003eth\u003c/sup\u003e Street, where she could teach good manners and closely monitor intake at the dinner table: “Is that four string beans on your plate? … Make it three.” Rules there were strict.

Befitting a feud in the land of appearances, John Casablancas of Elite Model Management was perfectly cast as the agency’s archenemy. If the Fords epitomized post-war optimism and family life, Casablancas was a walking embodiment of the sexual revolution. He sported a thick dark mustache, a mop of dark hair and a penchant for “boffing” his models. The Elite logo, in fact, “was inspired by the image of two testicles nestling on either side of an upright phallus.”\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eCasablancas, who opened his first agency in Paris in 1969, originally revered the Fords.

It was the established agency that followed the rules versus the rude upstart. There were vitriolic meetings and there were lawsuits. Models jumped from agency to agency and then back again. Each side had wins and losses. Stylist Shelly Promisel told Lacey, “There’s no doubt that the Model Wars were good for the whole of the U.S. fashion business, and for New York in particular. The publicity brought such attention to U.S. photographers, makeup artists, stylists and hairdressers—everyone involved. The rates paid to models went sky high. Girls that cost seven hundred and fifty a day were charging fifteen hundred dollars a few years after Elite arrived.” Lacey covers the Model Wars with all the enthusiasm and detail this fascinating episode deserves. It’s a magnificent example of the upheaval caused by shifts in the cultural bedrock.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eFor nearly half a century, Ford was a fundamental cog in the fashion infrastructure, often initiating change and sometimes at the mercy of it.

Lacey brings his narrative to a close soon after Ford and Jerry retired in 1993. This seems appropriate for a biography of a woman who once declared, “the opposite of work is death.” It is, after all, a book about how woman shaped an industry to meet her own standards. “If you want to do something, you can’t go on talking and talking about it,” Ford once explained. “That’s a very boring song.
