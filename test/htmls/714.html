This August, he opted to use the time that would have gone toward a second same-day practice for film study or a walkthrough instead. While the Hogs did lose star senior running back Jonathan Williams to a torn foot ligament in a scrimmage two weekends ago, Bielema believes the tact has worked so far.

They are supervising them more in the cold months, too, on account of a ceaselessly expanding spate of conference championships and bowl games. The College Football Playoff, capped at four teams for now but likely to balloon to eight or more teams, also demands more time.

He goes on to mention how the local bakery stocks a loaf called the SS loaf, named after the shop, “but that’s a loaf we never buy.” One winter’s day some children throw snowballs at their kitchen window and yell “Jews!” His mother’s face turns ashen—“Utterly white and utterly silent.” He is unsure of the meaning of the word, but “knows it has something to do with the shadows.”\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003e\u003ci\u003eA Brief Stop on the Road from Auschwitz\u003c/i\u003e touches upon Rosenberg’s childhood and blossoming self-awareness in postwar Sweden, but essentially it is his telling of his father’s story, one that chronicles the struggle to survive the Holocaust and then the struggle to live with the aftershock. The key word in the book’s title—other than its ugly last one—is “from.” For Rosenberg’s father, David, belonged to that rare minority that didn’t only go “to” Auschwitz; miraculously for him, the camp was a transit point not a final destination. He lived to tell his tale—except he didn’t, not openly, and certainly not to his son. And so drawing on the letters between his parents during their years of separation, along with trawling records and tracing routes, Rosenberg charts his father’s journey from his native Poland to his adoptive Sweden. The road to Auschwitz, he explains, is “a collective hell shared by each and every one.” The less-traveled road from Auschwitz, he discovers, “follows the most shifting routes, veers off to the most unpredictable destinations, and comes through the most unexpected places.”\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eThus Rosenberg rewinds from Södertälje in 1947 to the Łódź ghetto in 1942.

The sledgehammer-blow comes when its inhabitants are requested by their Nazi jailers to surrender the sick, the old and children under ten—20,000 “sacrifices” in eight days, after which, they are assured, “all will remain calm.” The implication behind this grotesque \u003ci\u003eAktion\u003c/i\u003e is clear: these people are being delivered up in order to be killed. Here and elsewhere Rosenberg weighs up the magnitude of the crime and reaches out to address his father directly: “Only misunderstanding and lack of imagination—this is how I see it—can keep your world together after September 1942.”\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eThe ghetto is liquidated two years later and his parents are sent on transports to Auschwitz.

His journey’s end was not quite the Promised Land he envisaged and he battled to stay afloat. It is not only his private memories that grind him down. Postwar Sweden, particularly its provincial backwaters, views the incoming stateless survivors with suspicion. “We are not used to dealing with people so alien to Swedish attitudes and standards,” the local newspaper declares. Astonishingly, the authorities categorize them as “former concentration camp clients.” That suspicion sours into downright distrust when, in the 1950s, David Rosenberg is examined by a German doctor with a view to claiming compensation for Nazi persecution. He is told that he is ill because he wants reparations, not because he has survived Auschwitz. His claim is rejected and he receives nothing.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eCumulatively, these hard knocks take their toll. The finishing touches Rosenberg makes to the portrait of his father are the darkest of dabs. The result is a chiaroscuro composed of more shade than light but one that manages to be all the more revealing because of it. Rosenberg floors us with a shock conclusion and provides us with a wealth of insight on the way to it. I thought my German \u003ci\u003eWortschatz\u003c/i\u003e was pretty ample but one terrible word that Rosenberg cites and one that is mercifully absent from modern dictionaries and common parlance is \u003ci\u003eEntjudung\u003c/i\u003e—“dejudification.” One of the book’s enduring images is of the residents of the town of Ludwigslust ordered by American troops to witness the atrocities committed at the nearby camp of Wöbbelin. We get this visually and on a larger scale in \u003ci\u003eNight Will Fall\u003c/i\u003e after the liberation of Dachau: American soldiers bringing in Germans from neighboring Weimar who had been willing to make use of the cheap labor of the camp—“as long as they were beyond smelling range of it.” Rosenberg’s account of Wöbbelin feels like a thumbnail sketch in comparison, but it comes clad with rich detail and accompanied by righteous ire: “the blatant lie” of “we knew nothing and could do nothing.” Both film and book show how flimsy these pleas of mitigation were and the measures the Allies took to refocus blind eyes, impose culpability and ensure that certain images once seen would never be forgotten.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eAt the height of the killing, when one overloaded transport after another hurtled towards the camps and the crematoria and fire pits were continually aflame—when the annihilation was relentless—the Nazis left scant possibility for victims to become testifying survivors. Even in 1945, while on the brink of defeat, Himmler instructed camp commandants to dismantle each \u003ci\u003eLager\u003c/i\u003e, wipe out all traces of mass murder and make sure that no prisoner fell into enemy hands alive. But Rosenberg tells us that those who do survive “don’t know what to say to be believed.” His father was struck dumb by what he suffered.

(Primo Levi also identified with the Ancient Mariner and used a quote from Coleridge’s poem—“…till my ghastly tale is told”—for the epitaph of his final collection of essays, \u003ci\u003eThe Drowned and the Saved\u003c/i\u003e.) Arrested by the Gestapo for Communist agitation and propaganda, Heiner is interrogated and tortured and then sent on to Auschwitz, that “playground of murder in Poland.” Like David Rosenberg he escapes selection for the gas chamber but is put to work and turned into “a striped skeleton.” However, instead of physical, back-breaking toil he has the mentally arduous duty of typing up death notices all day. He buckles under the psychological strain of watching and recording wholesale murder, but steels himself and utilizes his function by memorizing each crime on the off-chance that he can survive and be called upon as a reliable witness.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eSurvive he does, but when he is summoned in 1964 from Vienna to testify against 20 suspected war criminals in Frankfurt, the prospect of reliving a nightmare causes him to crumple and clam up. Two men in particular make him quake: Kaduk, who beat prisoners with a club, and Klehr, who injected “patients” with a phenol-filled syringe. Lena, the court translator, encourages him to be strong in words that evoke “shipwrecked” David Rosenberg: “Do you know what a wreck is?” she asks him. “A wreck is a ‘drifting object’ that has become unusable due to decay or damage. Decay certainly doesn’t apply to you.”\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eAs if to prove it, Lena falls for Heiner, and the pair settle down together and see to what degree love can heal trauma. To begin with it seems as if their 10-year age-gap will be the biggest stumbling block, but Lena comes to realize that Heiner is constantly haunted by his demons. This is a man who keeps a mustard jar full of ground bones from victims at Birkenau. For him it is no worse than living with yellowed photos of dead relatives: “Both are mementoes of people that don’t exist anymore.” And yet slowly she learns to understand his foibles, accommodate his pain and let him rant and wail whenever an innocuous occurrence triggers an appalling memory.\u003c/p\u003e"},{"resourceType":"mobilebeast2/components/text","text":"\u003cp\u003eHeld impresses with a segment that sees Heiner and Lena visiting Poland in the 1980s. The country is under martial law and Heiner’s old Polish Resistance friends are still fighting for democratic change but this time as supporters of Solidarity. The crux of the trip is a return to Auschwitz, “the world’s biggest graveyard,” where Heiner can confront his past and test the limits of Lena’s comprehension. Held intercalates Heiner’s pilgrimage and the flashbacks to his early years with snapshots of the consequences of his time in the camp: sleepless nights, ruined relationships, and an unassuaged urge to lose himself in Holocaust studies and impress on anyone within earshot anecdotes, images and tales. A fellow survivor asks Lena what it is like living with “one of us.” “What do you think it’s like?” she answers. “It’s like living with a singer who can’t stop singing the song of his life. He sings it in the morning, he sings it at noon and in the afternoon, evening, and night. It has many verses.

However, Held judiciously tempers the gloom by rotating perspectives and flitting backwards and forwards through time.
