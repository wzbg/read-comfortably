He has threatened to sue the <em>Journal <\/em>for libel; more controversially, he sacked his deputy prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, in a cabinet reshuffle in late July after Muhyiddin called for transparency in the matter.<\/p>\n<p>Today&#8217;s planned rally, which the authorities have deemed unlawful, is the latest exercise in political discontent within this once-promising Southeast Asian state. The engine of this discontent is an unofficial pro-democracy, anti-corruption coalition called Bersih, which in Malay simply means &#8220;clean.&#8221; Though the recent allegations of corruption have galvanized the demands for Najib&#8217;s removal from power, many Malaysians see the scandal simply as one visceral incident within an endemically broken system.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s dropped the economy,&#8221; Kad Pemandu, a taxi driver in Kuala Lumpur, tells TIME. &#8220;Everyone is very scared.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s very simple: the Malaysian people are suffering right now,&#8221; Ravin Kabhi, a Malaysian man who recently moved to Australia, said. &#8220;Look at our currency at the moment &mdash; it&#8217;s 4.2 to the dollar. I&#8217;m a recent graduate, and there are no jobs, because multinational corporations don&#8217;t want to spend money in periods of instability.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Malaysia has long sought to fashion its global image as a crucible of progressive politics and economic stability in Southeast Asia, and for many years, the portrait was compelling. Regular elections offered a facsimile of democracy. The construction of the Petronas Towers in 1998 &mdash; the tallest skyscrapers in the world until Taipei 101 opened in Taiwan six years later &mdash; provided an internationally recognizable emblem of the country&#8217;s capitalist triumph during the last two decades of the twentieth century.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4015830\"><\/div>\n<p>The controversies that have surrounded Najib&#8217;s leadership since his narrow election in 2009 have exposed the weaknesses in this narrative. Najib leads the United Malays National Organization (UMNO), the right-wing Malay nationalist party that heads the incumbent National Front coalition and derives most of its support from ethnic Malays who benefit from its policies. In September 2013, <a href=\"http:\/\/world.time.com\/2013\/09\/19\/malaysias-multiracial-promise-marred-by-bigotry-and-political-persecution\/\">Najib&#8217;s government fortified<\/a> longstanding laws that reserve education benefits, government jobs, and entrepreneurship opportunities for the ethnic Malay population.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;I support their right to do this, to protest,&#8221; ethnic Malay student Ziela Rahim said, gesturing to the yellow-shirted protesters who loitered beneath the metro tracks above Jalan Tun Perak. &#8220;But [Najib] is my prime minister, and so I think he has the right to do what he feels is right for us.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>But those same pro-Malay policies, political and economic experts contend, have encouraged hostility and also weakened the economy, because they have encouraged Malaysia&#8217;s marginalized Chinese and Indian populations to seek better opportunities elsewhere.<\/p>\n<p>Najib has also become increasingly strident in his dismissal of the growing opposition, even as ethnic Malays &mdash; the bulwark to his political legitimacy &mdash; join its ranks. On Saturday morning, the state held a full dress rehearsal for the country&#8217;s independence day celebration on August 31. The practice, held in the same public square where the anti-Najib protesters are to gather later in the day, was one of pomp and circumstance: military marching bands played the national anthem, which was amplified over loudspeakers; organized civilians in red t-shirts marched in lockstep, holding small Malaysian flags; military jets roared overhead.<\/p>\n<p>Outside of Merdeka Square, some members of the opposition, dressed in Bersih&#8217;s yellow shirts, had started to gather in anticipation.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Whether or not [today] has an effect on the political process isn&#8217;t important. It&#8217;s my duty &mdash; our duty &mdash; to align with the cause,&#8221; Lui Tuck, a 45-year-old factory manager from Kuala Lumpur, said. &#8220;The current government is disgusting. You want to tell lies, tell proper lies. If you want to take our money, take our money, but at least tell convincing lies that let us sleep at night.&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"World","slug":"world","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/world\/","description":"The latest news and analysis from TIME's correspondents on world

Republican White House hopeful and real estate mogul suggested that Abedin had shared classified information with her husband, disgraced ex-Rep. Anthony Weiner. Abedin, one of Clinton&rsquo;s longest serving aides and now the vice chairman of her presidential campaign, was Clinton&rsquo;s deputy chief of staff while she was Secretary of State and one of her most trusted advisers.<\/p>\n<p>Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill called Trump&#8217;s remarks &#8220;patently false, personal attacks towards a staff member.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>While Clinton&#8217;s critics are investigating her use of a private email server and whether classified information was sent to non-governmental accounts, no one had before suggested Abedin was passing sensitive materials to anyone who should not have had it. To Trump, Abedin is yet another shady figure involved in the never-ending saga of Clinton&rsquo;s email practices as the nation&rsquo;s top diplomat. &ldquo;It all came through Huma,&rdquo; whom Trump repeated called &ldquo;YOU-ma.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Who is Huma married to? One of the great sleazebags of our time, Anthony Weiner. She is married to Anthony Weiner. You know, the little bing, bing, bing,&rdquo; Trump went on.<\/p>\n<p>Weiner resigned from Congress amid a sexting scandal in 2011. Abedin remains married to him and they are raising a 3-year-old son.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Think about it. So Huma is getting classified secrets. She&rsquo;s married to Anthony Weiner, who is a pervert. He is. So these are confidential documents,&rdquo; Trump said, taking his typical asides to add tangential information. &ldquo;If you think that Huma isn&rsquo;t telling Anthony&mdash;who she is probably desperately in love with, in all fairness to Anthony, because why else would she marry this guy? Can you believe it? She can&rsquo;t see straight. Think of it.&rdquo;<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4015820\"><\/div>\n<p>Trump said Abedin&rsquo;s love for her husband likely compelled her to tell him things she should not have.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;Do you think there&rsquo;s even a 5% chance that she&rsquo;s not telling Anthony Weiner, now at a public relations firm, what the hell is coming across? Do you think there&rsquo;s even a little bit of a chance? I don&rsquo;t think so.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Trump&#8217;s decision to go after one of Clinton&#8217;s most loyal advisers was a new move for the real estate mogul, whose brash approach to the campaign has propelled him to the top of the polls.<\/p>\n<p>Abedin started working for Clinton while she was an undergraduate at George Washington University and Clinton was First Lady. She went on to work for Clinton&#8217;s Senate office and her 2008 presidential campaign and followed her to this one. She&#8217;s a constant presence at Clinton&#8217;s side; Clinton has likened Abedin to the second daughter she never had.<\/p>\n<p>Merrill, the Clinton spokesman, said Trump had gone too far: &#8220;Donald Trump has spent the summer saying offensive things about women, but there is no place for patently false, personal attacks towards a staff member. He should be ashamed of himself, and others in his own party should take a moment to stand up to him and draw the line for once. It&#8217;s embarrassing to watch, frankly.&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

A second is convinced he can start a political revolution. Another demands more debates. The other hopes you remember who he is.<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color:#000000;\">What began as an orderly quorum to rally Democrats for the 2016 general election spiraled on Friday into a chaotic pageant of candidates slamming debate schedules, assuaging fears over emails, lambasting Donald Trump and demanding political revolution. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Four of the five Democratic candidates for president addressed the Democratic National Committee members and leaders at the party&#8217;s summer meeting in Minneapolis, each seeking something different. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span class=\"s1\">The three-day confab is a key forum for the Democratic candidates to garner establishment support for their campaigns. Their speeches on Friday<\/span><span class=\"s1\"> evinced tensions within the party and a wide range of interests. <\/span><span class=\"s1\">But one battle line was clear: there&#8217;s the establishment wing of the party, and there&#8217;s everyone else. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Here&rsquo;s what each of the candidates aimed to prove at the DNC summer meeting, in the order that they spoke. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>Lincoln Chafee: <\/b>The former Rhode Island governor and senator, who has the mild demeanor of a mid-level manager, is polling at an unenviable 0.5%. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">So Chafee spent most of his brief speech reminding the Democratic Party who he is. He<span class=\"s1\"> boasted of his qualifications, telling the audience that as a prescient senator from Rhode Island in the early 2000s he voted against the Iraq War, warned of the dangers of climate change and supporte<\/span><\/span><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span class=\"s1\">d a bipartisan immigration bill. <\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span class=\"s1\">Plus, he has never been accused of a major scandal. &#8220;<\/span><span class=\"s1\">And all through these 30 years of public service, I&rsquo;ve had no scandal,&#8221; Chafee said. &#8220;I&rsquo;m proud of that.&rdquo;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color:#000000;\"><b>Hillary Clinton: <\/b>The Democratic frontrunner, firmly in the lead for the nomination with nearly 50% in an average of recent national polls, aimed to assure the DNC&rsquo;s leadership that she is the strongest candidate to rebuild the party after bad losses in the 2010 and 2014 midterms. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color:#000000;\">She vowed on Friday to help rebuild a Democratic Party whose ranks have been thinned by losses at the local and state level, telling top leaders of the Democratic National Committee that her campaign will help Democrats &#8220;win up and down the ticket.&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\"><span class=\"s1\">&#8220;I&#8217;m building an organization in all 50 states with hundreds of thousands of volunteers who will help Democrats win races up and down the ticket, not just the presidential campaign,&#8221; Clinton said. &#8220;Y<\/span><span class=\"s1\">ou know, in 2010 Republicans routed us on redistricting, not because they won Congress but because they won state legislatures. It&#8217;s time to rebuild our party from the ground up. And if you make me the nominee that&rsquo;s exactly what I&rsquo;ll do.&#8221;<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\" style=\"color:#000000;\">Meanwhile, her surrogates rounded up super-delegates at the DNC three-day meeting in an effort to build up a bulwark of support before the primary contests next year. Her goal is to assure Democrats uneasy after a rough August of press around her use of a personal email server. <\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Clinton also told reporters after her speech that the obsession with her emails is a passing fad. &#8220;I&#8217;<span class=\"s1\">m not frustrated,&#8221; she said in response to a reporter&#8217;s question, who asked her how she is feeling about a kerfuffle that has damaged her trustworthiness among voters. &#8220;I&#8217;m just trying to explain for people who have never had to follow this before that is is complicated.

The DNC\/HRC [Hillary Rodham Clinton] hookup is a shotgun wedding with no need for bullets.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">Also, Crawford told the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ijreview.com\/2015\/08\/406100-jim-webb-dnc-democratic-national-committee-hillary-clinton-fundraising\/\">IJReview<\/a> that Webb talking to the DNC is &ldquo;about as useful as sticking one&rsquo;s hand into a wood chipper.&rdquo;<\/span><\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><span style=\"color:#000000;\">By July 2016, the party will have chosen its candidate for president, and the DNC hopes that the losing candidates will fall in line.

Lindsey Graham is taking aim at Republican rival John Kasich, saying the Ohio Governor is &ldquo;not ready to be Commander in Chief.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The South Carolina Republican and White House hopeful told roughly a dozen New Hampshire voters on Friday that Kasich disqualified himself from the presidency when he said he supported spending cuts that have impacted the military. Graham, a foreign policy hawk, has long opposed the $85 billion in spending cuts that automatically kicked in when Congress failed to reach a budget deal.<\/p>\n<p>Kasich, a former House Budget Committee Chairman, said told radio host Hugh Hewitt that he wanted to reform the Pentagon more broadly and that meant more than just undoing the budget cuts, which are deeply unpopular in both parties. &ldquo;The sequester doesn&rsquo;t matter to me,&rdquo; he said.<\/p>\n<p>Graham used his trip to New Hampshire&mdash;his second in as many weekends&mdash;to criticize Kasich, a relatively new entrant to the race but someone who is outpacing Graham in the polls.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;John Kasich is a good friend of mine,&rdquo; Graham said before turning to his criticism. &ldquo;He said he has no problem with sequestration.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>Graham went on: &ldquo;These are mandatory, across-the-board cuts to defense that will accumulate to the point that, by 2021, we will be spending half of what we&rsquo;d normally spend on the Defense Department.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>The cuts, he said, would hurt the United States&rsquo; national security.<\/p>\n<p>&ldquo;As the enemy increases in its ability, our approach is to disarm,&rdquo; Graham said. &ldquo;If the next president doesn&rsquo;t understand that these cuts are killing us, in terms of defending ourselves, you&rsquo;re not ready to be Commander in Chief&#8230;. This is a cocktail for disaster.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p>A Kasich spokesman dismissed Graham&#8217;s criticism. &#8220;The Governor wants to life the sequester for military and spend more if necessary, but he still wants to reform the Pentagon,&#8221; Chris Schrimpf said. &#8220;So the sequester doesn&#8217;t matter to him in that he still wants to reform the Pentagon, but is against across-the-board cuts.&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Politics","slug":"politics","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/politics\/","description":"Political insight from the Beltway and beyond.

But all bets are off if you throw in a third, less attractive frog, new research shows.<\/p>\n<p>Researchers evaluated mating calls from male t&uacute;ngara frog for the new <a href=\"http:\/\/www.sciencemag.org\/lookup\/doi\/10.1126\/science.aab2012\" target=\"_blank\">study<\/a>, published this week in the journal <em>Science. <\/em>The finding adds to a growing body of research suggesting that mating choices don&#8217;t follow rational expectations.<\/p>\n<p>Male frogs produce a sound to advertise themselves to potential mates. Female frogs typically responded best to longer calls made at a lower frequency when choosing between two male options. But when researchers added a third option to the mix that performed worse on both metrics, the female frog would often choose the intermediate option.<\/p>\n<p>Study author Amanda Lea, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin, likened the scenario, known as the &#8220;decoy effect,&#8221; to the way in which a consumer might behave when purchasing a new car. A customer may opt to buy a cheap car with poor fuel efficiency instead of a more expensive car with good fuel efficiency. But the costumer might reconsider when a salesmen presents a third option that is the most expensive and also has good fuel efficiency.

a press release from the Queens District Attorney&#8217;s Office, but the TSA agent allegedly insisted she come into the bathroom with him. When she asked if all passengers were screened this way, he said they were. In the bathroom, the agent groped the victim, before saying into his cell phone something like &#8220;she&#8217;s clear, she doesn&#8217;t have any weapons or knives,&#8221; according to the DA&#8217;s office.<\/p>\n<p>The TSA has terminated the agent and is cooperating with the Port Authority on the investigation, a TSA spokesman said.

Hirschfeld and President of the Board of Trustees James M. Waterbury was sent just after a jury issued a mixed verdict in Labrie&#8217;s case Friday afternoon. The jury determined Labrie was not guilty of felony sexual assault but found him guilty of three related misdemeanor charges, and a felony charge of luring a minor through a computer. He will have to register as a sex offender and could face up to 11 years in prison.<\/p>\n<p>The girl alleged Labrie raped her in a remote area of the school after sending her an invitation to participate in the &#8220;senior salute&#8221; ritual, a tradition in which upperclass boys are said to compete to &#8220;score&#8221; with as many girls as possible before graduation. Labrie said he and the girl never had sex. From the jury&#8217;s <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2015\/08\/30\/magazine\/the-lessons-of-anwar-al-awlaki.html?smid=tw-share\">mixed verdict,<\/a> it seems that they believe the pair had sex, but were divided on whether it was consensual.<\/p>\n<p>In the letter to the St. Paul&#8217;s community, Hirschfeld and Waterbury said the sexual &#8220;traditions&#8221; discussed during the trial were not actually part of the school&#8217;s history. &#8220;Many terms, including &#8216;senior salute&#8217; and &#8216;score&#8217; that are part of the student vernacular, have been discussed as part of the trial,&#8221; the letter said. &#8220;There is no place for inappropriate and hurtful behavior that disrespects any member of our School. Conduct that is damaging to the fabric of our community and inconsistent with our values has never been&mdash;and will not be&mdash;tolerated.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Rector first heard about the &#8216;senior salute&#8217; in the spring of 2013,&#8221; the letter continued. &#8220;It is not a decades-old &#8216;tradition&#8217; as some have alleged.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The St. Paul&#8217;s leaders also noted that the incident and subsequent trial could be considered a wake-up-call about the role of social media in romantic relationships, and how teenage sexual activity has changed in the 21st century.<\/p>\n<p class=\"p1\">&#8220;We have been painfully reminded of the fact that social media can provide an adult-free space for negative student culture to form and perpetuate itself,&#8221; Hirschfeld and Waterbury wrote. &#8220;We have learned that what was once termed &#8216;dating&#8217; or &#8216;courting&#8217; behavior has been inverted in some instances from our traditional sensibilities&mdash;sexual contact is now seen as the point of origin of many relationships, not a part of an emotionally developed relationship.&#8221;<\/p>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"U.S.","slug":"us","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/us\/","description":"The latest news and analysis on crime, religion, education, transportation, weather, immigration, sports, drugs, the law, and other news from around the nation","us":true},"tag":{"name":"Crime","slug":"crime","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/tag\/crime\/"},"tags":"Crime|owen labrie|prep school|Rape|School|Sexual Assault|st pauls","hero":{"class":"landscape","thumbnail":"http:\/\/i1.wp.com\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/prep-school-rape-trial.jpg?crop=1605px%2C385px%2C848px%2C848px&resize=100%2C100&quality=65&strip=color","src":{"small":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/prep-school-rape-trial.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=280","small_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/prep-school-rape-trial.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=560","large":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/prep-school-rape-trial.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=550","large_2x":"https:\/\/timedotcom.files.wordpress.com\/2015\/08\/prep-school-rape-trial.jpg?quality=65&strip=color&w=1100"},"credit":"Jim Cole\u2014AP","caption":"The entrance to the elite St. Paul\u2019s School in Concord, N.H., is seen on Aug. 14, 2015.","alt":"The entrance to the elite St. Paul\u2019s School is seen Friday Aug. 14, 2015 in Concord, N.H., Monday, Aug. 17, 2015, Owen Labrie, a former student, goes on trial Monday, Aug. 17, 2015, for taking part in a practice at the school known as \u201cSenior Salute\u201d where graduating boys try to take the virginity of younger girls before the school year ends.
