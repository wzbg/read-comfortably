In 1983, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Libet\">Benjamin Libet</a> sparked controversy with his demonstration that our sense of free will may be an illusion, a controversy that has only increased ever since.</p><p>Libet&rsquo;s experiment has three vital components: a choice, a measure of brain activity and a clock.</p><p>The choice is to move either your left or right arm. In the original version of the experiment this is by flicking your wrist; in some versions of the experiment it is to raise your left or right finger. Libet&rsquo;s participants were instructed to &ldquo;<a href=\"http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/3/623\">let the urge [to move] appear on its own at any time without any pre-planning or concentration on when to act</a>&rdquo;. The precise time at which you move is recorded from the muscles of your arm.</p><p>The measure of brain activity is taken via electrodes on the scalp. When the electrodes are placed over the motor cortex (roughly along the middle of the head), a different electrical signal appears between right and left as you plan and execute a movement on either the left or right.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yy7qm\"}}</p><p>The clock is specially designed to allow participants to discern sub-second changes. This clock has a single dot, which travels around the face of the clock every 2.56 seconds. This means that by reporting position you are reporting time. If we assume you can report position accurately to 5 degree angle, that means you can use this clock to report time to within 36 milliseconds&nbsp;&ndash; that&rsquo;s 36 thousandths of a second.</p><p>Putting these ingredients together, Libet took one extra vital measurement. He asked participants to report, using the clock, exactly the point when they made the decision to move.</p><blockquote><p> The brain activity showed that the decision had often already been made, before the participants were aware of having taken action </p></blockquote><p>Physiologists had known for decades that a fraction of a second before you actually move the electrical signals in your brain change. So it was in Libet&rsquo;s experiment, a fraction of a second before participants moved, a reliable change could be recorded using the electrodes. But the explosive result was when participants reported <em>deciding </em>to move. This occurred <em>in between</em> the electric change in the brain and the actual movement. This means, as sure as cause follows effect, that the feeling of deciding couldn&rsquo;t be a timely report of whatever was causing the movement. The electrode recording showed that the decision had &ndash; in some sense&nbsp;&ndash; already been made before the participants were aware of having taken action. The brain signals were changing before the subjective experience of taking a decision occurred.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02yy7xm\"}}</p><p>Had participants&rsquo; brains already made the decision? Was the feeling of choosing just an illusion? Controversy has raged ever since. There is far more to the discussion about neuroscience and free will than this one experiment, but its simplicity has allowed it to capture the imagination of many who think our status as biological creatures limits our free will, as well as those who argue that free will survives the challenge of our minds being firmly grounded in our biological brains.</p><p>Part of the appeal of the Libet experiment is due to two pervasive intuitions we have about the mind. Without these intuitions the experiment doesn&rsquo;t seem so surprising.</p><p>The first intuition is the feeling that our minds are a separate thing from our physical selves&nbsp;&ndash; a natural dualism that pushes us to believe that the mind is a pure, abstract place, free from biological constraints. A moment&rsquo;s thought about the last time you were grumpy because you were hungry shatters this illusion, but I&rsquo;d argue that it is still a persistent theme in our thinking. Why else would we be the least surprised that it is possible to find neural correlates of mental events? If we really believed, in our heart of hearts, that the mind is based in the brain, then we would know that every mental change must have a corresponding change in the brain.</p><p>The second pervasive intuition, which makes us surprised by the Libet experiment, is the belief that we know our own minds. This is the belief that our subjective experience of making decisions is an accurate report of how that decision is made. The mind is like a machine&nbsp;&ndash; as long as it runs right, we are happily ignorant of how it works. It is only when mistakes or contradictions arise that we&rsquo;re drawn to look under the hood: Why didn&rsquo;t I notice that exit? How could I forget that person&rsquo;s name? Why does the feeling of deciding come after the brain changes associated with decision making?</p><blockquote><p> There&rsquo;s no reason to think that we are reliable reporters of every aspect of our minds&rsquo; contents </p></blockquote><p>There&rsquo;s no reason to think that we are reliable reporters of every aspect of our minds. Psychology, in fact, gives us lots of examples of where we often get things wrong. The feeling of deciding in the Libet experiment may be a complete illusion&nbsp;&ndash; maybe the real decision really is made &lsquo;by our brains&rsquo; somehow&nbsp;&ndash; or maybe it is just that the feeling of deciding is delayed from our actual deciding. Just because we erroneously report the timing of the decision, doesn&rsquo;t mean we weren&rsquo;t intimately involved in it, in whatever meaningful sense that can be.</p><p>More is written about the Libet experiment every year. It has spawned an academic industry investigating the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will\">neuroscience of free will</a>. There are many criticisms and rebuttals, with debate raging about how and if the experiment is relevant to the freedom of our everyday choices. Even supporters of Libet have to admit that the situation used in the experiment may be too artificial to be a direct model of real everyday choices. But the basic experiment continues to inspire discussion and provoke new thoughts about the way our freedom is rooted in our brains. And that, I&rsquo;d argue, is due to the way it helps us confront our intuitions about the way the mind works, and to see that things are more complex than we instinctively imagine.</p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tomstafford\">@tomstafford</a> on Twitter, or ideas@idiolect.org.uk.</p><p>Follow BBC Future</em> <em>on</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><strong><em>Facebook</em></strong></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><strong><em>Twitter</em></strong></a>, <a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><strong><em>Google+</em></strong></a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/bbc-com\"><strong><em>LinkedIn</em></strong></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[{"Content":{"FileSizeBytes":0,"MimeType":"unknown","SourceHeight":0,"SourceUrl":"http://deltaorigin.bbc.co.uk/images/live/p0/0q/8t/p00q8td2.jpg","SourceWidth":0,"SynopsisLong":"Neurohacks","SynopsisMedium":"Neurohacks","SynopsisShort":"Neurohacks","TemplateUrl":"http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/$recipe/images/live/p0/0q/8t/p00q8td2.jpg","Title":"neuroHacks.jpg","CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p00q8td2","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Entity":"","Guid":"","Id":"p00q8td2","ModifiedDateTime":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","Project":"","Slug":""},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:image:p00q8td2","_id":"55e3edff4cfb5a40c5083565"}],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Neuroscience and the psychology of the everyday.

If it was just 100 light years away it could blow the atmosphere off,&rdquo; says Gehrels matter-of-factly.</p><p>&ldquo;The chances of that happening to the Earth is fairly small, about once in a billion years,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s certainly not as great a threat as a giant asteroid hitting our planet.&rdquo; Still, it probably pays to keep an eye on them.</p><p><strong>Round-the-clock detection</strong></p><p>Gehrels leads the international team of scientists &ndash; with members in the US, UK and Italy &ndash; operating the Swift satellite, which they use to study the behaviour and origins of these cosmic events . In orbit since November 2004, the spacecraft is named after its ability to respond instantly to any of the 90 or so high-energy flashes of radiation it detects each year.</p><p>As soon as Swift detects a gamma ray burst somewhere in its field of view, the satellite rotates to point its X-ray and optical telescopes in that direction. Meanwhile back on Earth, within a few seconds of the blast going off, the science team are notified by text message.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w1w\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;Immediately &ndash; even if we&rsquo;re on the road somewhere &ndash; we&rsquo;ll go to our laptops, log in and then get on the phone to teleconference with other members of the team,&rdquo; says Gehrels. Within 15 minutes of the burst, they will have issued an alert so that other observatories on the ground can point their telescopes towards the source.</p><p>Like being a doctor on call, duty scientists working on Swift even get woken up in the middle of the night to react to an event on the other side of the cosmos. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s really exciting, you&rsquo;re making discoveries and learning something new at all hours of the day and night.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Black holes and revelations</strong></p><p>However, not everyone agrees with this assessment. &ldquo;My wife was amused by this at the beginning, pretty soon it got to be annoying,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;As more time went on, she&rsquo;d just sleep right through it.&rdquo;</p><p>Before Swift was launched, no one knew for sure what caused gamma ray bursts. Now astronomers are fairly certain that the longer bursts &ndash; that is anything over two seconds &ndash; are caused when the centre of massive stars collapse in on themselves forming black holes. When the stars subsequently explode into oblivion, a jet of gamma rays is blasted out across space.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5w89\"}}</p><p>The second type of these explosions (anything shorter than two seconds) is categorised as short bursts. The Swift team has concluded that these are caused by the collision of two dense neutron stars. These cosmic bodies are just a few kilometres across but have a similar mass to the Sun. Which helps explain why the resulting explosion is so phenomenal.</p><p>What the Swift scientists have also discovered is that gamma ray bursts are vitally important to the evolution of the Universe. &ldquo;When a gamma ray burst goes off near a star with a planetary system, it can have a very important and destructive influence,&rdquo; says Gehrels.</p><p><strong>Time warp</strong></p><p>The explosions that result in gamma ray bursts might even have provided all the gold in the Universe. &ldquo;There was a burst that had an unusual afterglow that told us that a lot of heavy elements like gold had been produced,&rdquo; Gehrels says. &ldquo;It certainly gives us a clue where gold comes from.&rdquo;</p><p>Because light from the other side of the Universe takes so long to reach the Earth, some gamma rays bursts spotted by Swift actually began their journey towards us shortly after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago. When a blast goes off, it illuminates that particular region of space enabling astronomers to get a glimpse back in time to the birth of the very first stars 500 million-or-so years after the Universe came into existence.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wvk\"}}</p><p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve learnt what the early Universe was like,&rdquo; says Gehrels. &ldquo;When the Universe was born, the only elements were hydrogen and helium but explosions started to seed the galaxy with higher elements like carbon, nitrogen and iron &ndash; the elements that make up our bodies.&rdquo;</p><p>Not only do we owe our very existence to cosmic explosions, there is some evidence that the Earth&rsquo;s ecosystem has been directly affected by these bursts of energy. Research published in 2013 suggested that a blast of radiation that hit our planet in the 8th Century may have been the result of a gamma ray burst, though Gehrels is inclined to reserve judgement.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02n5wcw\"}}</p><p>After 10 years of observations, he reckons Swift is good for at least another five years but it has already transformed how astronomers see the Universe.</p><p>&ldquo;Before Swift, astronomers used to think the Universe was a steady set of stars and galaxies,&rdquo; he says.</p><p>&ldquo;But if we put on our gamma ray glasses and look up at the sky, it&rsquo;s always popping and bubbling and flashing &ndash; it&rsquo;s a very different kind of violent Universe.&rdquo;</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-04-01T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The Nasa team keeping tabs on intergalactic death rays","HeadlineShort":"Nasa’s cosmic death ray spy ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A space mission tracking the most violent explosions in the Universe has just celebrated its 10th anniversary.

After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump &ndash; only to smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it doesn&rsquo;t take long for his friends to crack up.</p><p>&ldquo;They start laughing as soon as they see there isn&rsquo;t blood and bones everywhere,&rdquo; says Scott. &ldquo;And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it&rsquo;s absolutely helpless.&rdquo; (If you want to see the video in question, you can find it <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zd7c5tQCs1I\">here</a> &ndash; though it does contain some swearing.)</p><p>Why do we get such an attack of the giggles &ndash; even when someone is in pain? And why is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent the last few years trying to answer these questions &ndash; and at <a href=\"https://conferences.ted.com/TED2015/program/speakers.php\">TED2015 in Vancouver</a> last week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood, behaviours.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbk4\"}}</p><p>Scott&rsquo;s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She likes to point out a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sophiescott/status/344540010416062464\">handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts</a>. &ldquo;This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will be disposed of if not collected,&rdquo; the note read. &ldquo;Is this science?&rdquo; In an ironic nod to the criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.</p><p>She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich information it offers about our identity. &ldquo;You can get a good shot at my gender, my age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and even things to do with interactions,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people&rsquo;s speech (see video, below). Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally associated with<a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20026845.800-voice-impersonators-use-brain-to-become-characters.html\"> bodily motion and visualisation</a> &ndash; as he, almost literally, tried to work his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like <a href=\"http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/News/Media-office/Press-releases/2013/WTP052948.htm\">accent and articulation</a> &ndash; important aspects of our vocal identity.</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Duncan-Wisbey-Impressions-Voice\"}}</p><p>But it was a study in Namibia that made Scott begin to realise laughter is one of our richest vocal tics. Previous research had shown that we can all recognise six universal emotions across cultures&nbsp;&ndash; fear, anger, surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness &ndash; based on facial expressions. Scott, however, wanted to see if we encode more subtle information in our voice. So she asked indigenous Namibians and English people to listen to recordings of each other and rate the emotions represented &ndash; including the six accepted universals, as well as relief, triumph, or contentment.</p><p>Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. &ldquo;Almost immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,&rdquo; she says.</p><p>The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do with humour. &ldquo;People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people&rsquo;s jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is the person who is talking,&rdquo; she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a &ldquo;social emotion&rdquo; that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is actually funny. &ldquo;When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them, you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Laughter is an index of the strength of a relationship.&rdquo;</p><p><strong>Infectious giggles</strong></p><p>That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other&rsquo;s apparent wit &ndash; while onlookers fail to be infected. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll hear someone say &lsquo;he&rsquo;s got a great sense of humour and I really fancy him because of it&rsquo;.&nbsp; What you mean is &lsquo;I fancy him and I show him I like him by laughing when I&rsquo;m around him.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p><p>Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event &ndash; and overall, they are likely to stay together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at funny videos are also more likely <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25762120\">to open up about personal information</a> &ndash; paving more common ground between people.</p><p>Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have united the friends. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing &ndash; I think it&rsquo;s to make him feel better,&rdquo; says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University of Oxford has found that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21920973\">laughter correlates with increased pain threshold</a>, perhaps by encouraging the release of endorphins &ndash; chemicals that should also improve social bonding.</p><p>Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the &ldquo;posed&rdquo; giggles we might use to pepper our conversation &ndash; and the absolutely involuntary fits that can destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:</p><p>{\"magnify\":{ \"id\": \"Jonathan-Agnew-Aggers-Brian-Joh\"}}</p><p>For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal &ndash; whereas our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose.</p><p>Her fMRI scans, meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter. Both seem to tickle the brain&rsquo;s mirror regions &ndash; the areas that tend to mimic other&rsquo;s actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it myself, for instance &ndash; and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so contagious. &ldquo;You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you&rsquo;re with someone else,&rdquo; she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with &ldquo;mentalising&rdquo; and working out other people&rsquo;s motives &ndash; perhaps because we want to understand why they are faking it.</p><p>You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London&rsquo;s Science Museum, where her team will be <a href=\"http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/visitmuseum/plan_your_visit/events/demonstrations_and_experiments/live-science.aspx\">asking visitors of different ages to judge</a> the authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out that crying is an infant&rsquo;s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more importance the older we get.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02mfbry\"}}</p><p>Although we may tend to dislike certain people&rsquo;s &ldquo;fake&rdquo; laughs, Scott thinks it probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals, than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. &ldquo;I always thought that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that what was odd was simply the fact I didn&rsquo;t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.&rdquo; If she hadn&rsquo;t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and wouldn&rsquo;t have even noticed.</p><p>Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people&rsquo;s laughter:</p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196674949&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p><p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"166\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"no\" src=\"https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/196675425&amp;color=000000&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=true&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false\"></iframe></p><p>Beside probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott&rsquo;s curiosity has also taken her to comedy clubs. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s interesting about laughter in the situation of stand-up is that it&rsquo;s still an interaction,&rdquo; she says. In a way, the audience is having a conversation with the comedian. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested in what happens when the audience starts laughing and how it dies away &ndash; whether are you in sync with people around you or whether you don&rsquo;t care, because the experience is just between you and the person on the stage.&rdquo;</p><p>Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues, perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can catch on more easily when there are more people.

It sounds like one of the most fun questions a researcher could investigate, but there's a serious scientific reason why Caspar Addyman wants to find out.</p><p>He&rsquo;s not the first to ask this question. Darwin studied laughter in his infant son, and Freud formed a theory that our tendency to laugh originates in a sense of superiority. So we take pleasure at seeing another's suffering - slapstick style pratfalls and accidents being good examples - because it isn&rsquo;t us.</p><p>The great psychologist of human development, Jean Piaget, thought that babies&rsquo; laughter could be used to see into their minds. If you laugh, you must 'get the joke' to some degree - a good joke is balanced in between being completely unexpected and confusing and being predictable and boring. Studying when babies laugh might therefore be a great way of gaining insight into how they understand the world, he reasoned. But although he proposed this in the 1940s, this idea remains to be properly tested. Despite the fact that some very famous investigators have studied the topic, it has been neglected by modern psychology.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02y7c75\"}}</p><p>Addyman, of Birkbeck, University of London, is out to change that. He believes we can use laughter to get at exactly how infants understand the world. He's completed the world's largest and most comprehensive survey of what makes babies laugh, presenting <a href=\"http://babylaughter.net/blog/baby-laughter-survey-scientific-update/\">his initial results</a> at the International Conference on Infant Studies, Berlin, last year. Via <a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbabylaughter.net&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGPL6-9AHNfBja2ZNSinEpL33JzAw\">his website </a>he surveyed more than 1000 parents from around the world, asking them questions about when, where and why their babies laugh.</p><p>The results are - like the research topic - heart-warming. A baby's first smile comes at about six weeks, their first laugh at about three and a half months (although some took three times as long to laugh, so don't worry if your baby hasn&rsquo;t cracked its first cackle just yet). Peekaboo is a sure-fire favourite for making babies laugh (for a variety of reasons <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140417-why-all-babies-love-peekaboo\">I've written about here</a>), but tickling is the single most reported reason that babies laugh.</p><blockquote><p> Babies are far more likely to laugh when they fall over, rather than when someone else falls over </p></blockquote><p>Importantly, from the very first chuckle, the survey responses show that babies are laughing with other people, and at what they do. The mere physical sensation of something being ticklish isn&rsquo;t enough. Nor is it enough to see something disappear or appear suddenly. It&rsquo;s only funny when an adult makes these things happen for the baby. This shows that way before babies walk, or talk, they - and their laughter - are social. If you tickle a baby they apparently laugh because you are tickling them, not just because they are being tickled.</p><p>What's more, babies don't tend to laugh at people falling over. They are far more likely to laugh when they fall over, rather than someone else, or when other people are happy, rather than when they are sad or unpleasantly surprised. From these results, Freud's theory (which, in any case, was developed based on clinical interviews with adults, rather than any rigorous formal study of actual children) - looks dead wrong.</p><p>Although parents report that boy babies laugh slightly more than girl babies, both genders find mummy and daddy equally funny.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02y7c6x\"}}</p><p>Addyman continues to collect data, and hopes that as the results become clearer he'll be able to use his analysis to show how laughter tracks babies' developing understanding of the world - how surprise gives way to anticipation, for example, as their ability to remember objects comes online.</p><p>Despite the scientific potential, baby laughter is, as a research topic, &ldquo;strangely neglected&rdquo;, <a href=\"http://www.redorbit.com/news/science/1112730895/baby-laughter-interview-addyman-111312/\">according to Addyman</a>. Part of the reason is the difficulty of making babies laugh reliably in the lab, although he plans to tackle this in the next phase of the project. But partly the topic has been neglected, he says, because it isn't viewed as a subject for 'proper' science to look into. This is a prejudice Addyman hopes to overturn - for him, the study of laughter is certainly no joke.</p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\">@tomstafford</a> or <a href=\"mailto:ideas@idiolect.org.uk\">ideas@idiolect.org.uk</a>.

Half the participants were given a copy of the test paper which had &ndash; apparently in error &ndash; been printed with the answers listed at the bottom. This meant they had to resist the temptation to check or improve their answers against the real answers as they went along.</p><p><strong>Irresistible shortcut<br /> </strong><br /> As you'd expect, some of these participants couldn&rsquo;t help but cheat. Collectively, the group that had access to the answers performed better on the tests than participants who didn't &ndash; even though both groups of participants were selected at random from students at the same university, so were, on average, of similar ability. &nbsp;(We can't know for sure who was cheating &ndash; probably some of the people who had answers would have got high scores even without the answers &ndash; but it means that the average performance in the group was partly down to individual smarts, and partly down to having the answers at hand.)</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ktlms\"}}</p><p>The crucial question for Chance's research was this: did people in the &ldquo;cheater&rdquo; group know that they'd been relying on the answers? Or did they attribute their success in the tests solely to their own intelligence?</p><p>The way the researchers tested this was to ask the students to predict how well they'd do on a follow-up test. They were allowed to quickly glance over the second test sheet so that they could see that it involved the same kind of questions &ndash; and, importantly, that no answers had been mistakenly been printed at the bottom this time. The researchers reasoned that if the students who had cheated realised that cheating wasn&rsquo;t an option the second time around, they should predict they wouldn't do as well on this second test.</p><p>Not so. Self-deception won the day. The people who'd had access to the answers predicted, on average, that they'd get higher scores on the follow-up &ndash; equivalent to giving them something like a 10-point IQ boost. When tested, of course, they scored far lower.</p><p>The researchers ran another experiment to check that the effect was really due to the cheaters&rsquo; inflated belief in their own abilities. In this experiment, students were offered a cash reward for accurately predicting their scores on the second test. Sure enough, those who had been given the opportunity to cheat overestimated their ability and lost out &ndash; earning 20% less than the other students.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ktlmq\"}}</p><p>The implication is that people in Chance's experiment &ndash; people very much like you and me &ndash; had tricked themselves into <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131125-why-the-stupid-say-theyre-smart\">believing they were smarter than they were</a>. There may be benefits from doing this &ndash; confidence, satisfaction, or more easily gaining the trust of others &ndash; but there are also certainly disadvantages. Whenever circumstances change and you need to accurately predict how well you'll do, it can cost to believe you're better than you are.</p><p>That self-deception has its costs has some interesting implications. Morally, most of us would say that self-deception is wrong. But aside from whether self-deception is undesirable, we should expect it to be present in all of us to some degree (because of the benefits), but to be limited as well (because of the costs).</p><p>Self-deception isn't something that is always better in larger doses &ndash; there must be an amount of it for which the benefits outweigh the costs, most of the time. We're probably all self-deceiving to some degree. The irony being, because it is self-deception, we can't know how often.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</p><p><strong>Read more:<br /> </strong></em><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131125-why-the-stupid-say-theyre-smart\">{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01m5gph\"}}</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131125-why-the-stupid-say-theyre-smart\">The more inept you are the smarter you think you are</a></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-26T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"The invisible downside of cheating in life","HeadlineShort":"Unexpected downside for cheaters","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"People who take shortcuts can trick themselves into believing they are smarter than they are, says Tom Stafford, and it comes back to bite them.","IsSyndicated":true,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"People who take shortcuts can trick themselves into believing they are smarter than they are, says Tom Stafford, and it comes back to bite them.","SummaryShort":"The invisible dangers of taking shortcuts","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-02-26T00:06:20Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"0e427e1f-3f9f-4a8c-b6ef-4ad931a5ac36","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150225-unexpected-downside-for-cheaters","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-02-26T00:06:20Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150225-unexpected-downside-for-cheaters"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150225-unexpected-downside-for-cheaters","_id":"55dc58064cfb5a40c5f2ba0f"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>How much of our brain do we actually need? A number of stories have appeared in the news in recent months about people with chunks of their brains missing or damaged. These cases tell a story about the mind that goes deeper than their initial shock factor. It isn't just that we don't understand how the brain works, but that we may be thinking about it in the entirely wrong way.</p><p>Earlier this year, a <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329861.900-woman-of-24-found-to-have-no-cerebellum-in-her-brain.html\">case was reported</a> of a <a href=\"http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/08/22/brain.awu239.extract\">woman who is missing her cerebellum</a>, a distinct structure found at the back of the brain. By some estimates the human cerebellum contains half the brain cells you have. This isn't just brain damage &ndash; the whole structure is absent. Yet this woman lives a normal life; she graduated from school, got married and had a kid following an uneventful pregnancy and birth. A pretty standard biography for a 24-year-old.</p><p>The woman wasn't completely unaffected &ndash; she had suffered from uncertain, clumsy, movements her whole life. But the surprise is how she moves at all, missing a part of the brain that is so fundamental it evolved with the first vertebrates. The <a href=\"http://bio.sunyorange.edu/updated2/comparative_anatomy/anat.html2/n_CEREBELLUM.htm\">sharks that swam when dinosaurs walked the Earth had cerebellums</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02fcm06\"}}</p><p>This case points to a sad fact about brain science. We don't often shout about it, but there are large gaps in even our basic understanding of the brain. We can't agree on the function of even some of the most important brain regions, such as the cerebellum. Rare cases such as this show up that ignorance. Every so often someone walks into a hospital and their brain scan reveals the <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12301-man-with-tiny-brain-shocks-doctors.html\">startling differences we can have inside our heads</a>. Startling differences which may have only small observable effects on our behaviour.</p><p>Part of the problem may be our way of thinking. It is natural to see the brain as a piece of naturally selected technology, and in human technology there is often a one-to-one mapping between structure and function. If I have a toaster, the heat is provided by the heating element, the time is controlled by the timer and the popping up is driven by a spring. The case of the missing cerebellum reveals there is no such simple scheme for the brain. Although we love to talk about the brain region for vision, for hunger or for love, there are no such brain regions, because the brain isn't technology where any function is governed by just one part.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02fcm1k\"}}</p><p>Take another recent case, that of a man who was found to have a tapeworm in his brain. Over four years it burrowed \"<a href=\"http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/11/510/abstract\">from one side to the other</a>\", causing a variety of problems such as seizures, memory problems and weird smell sensations. Sounds to me like he got off lightly for having a living thing move through his brain. If the brain worked like most designed technology this wouldn't be possible. If a worm burrowed from one side of your phone to the other, the gadget would die. Indeed, when an early electromechanical computer malfunctioned in the 1940s, an investigation revealed the problem: a moth trapped in a relay &ndash; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#mediaviewer/File:H96566k.jpg\">the first actual case of a computer bug being found</a>.</p><p>Part of the explanation for the brain's apparent resilience is its 'plasticity' &ndash; an ability to adapt its structure based on experience. But another clue comes from a <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/98/24/13763.short\">concept advocated by Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist Gerald Edelman</a>. He noticed that biological functions are often supported by multiple structures &ndash; single physical features are coded for by multiple genes, for example, so that knocking out any single gene can't prevent that feature from developing apparently normally. He called the ability of multiple different structures to support a single function 'degeneracy'.</p><p><a href=\"http://193.62.66.20/~karl/Degeneracy%20and%20cognitive%20anatomy.pdf\">And so it is with the brain</a>. The important functions our brain carries out are not farmed out to single distinct brain regions, but instead supported by multiple regions, often in similar but slightly different ways. If one structure breaks down, the others can pick up the slack.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02fclzb\"}}</p><p>This helps explain why cognitive neuroscientists have such problems working out what different brain regions do. If you try and understand brain areas using a simple one-function-per-region and one-region-per-function rule you'll never be able to design the experiments needed to unpick the degenerate tangle of structure and function.</p><p>The cerebellum is most famous for controlling precise movements, but other areas of the brain such as the basal ganglia and the motor cortex are also intimately involved in moving our bodies. Asking what unique thing each area does may be the wrong question, when they are all contributing to the same thing. Memory is another example of an essential biological function which seems to be supported by multiple brain systems. If you bump into someone you've met once before, you might remember that they have a reputation for being nice, remember a specific incident of them being nice, or just retrieve a vague positive feeling about them &ndash; all forms of memory which tell you to trust this person, and all supported by different brain areas doing the same job in a slightly different way.</p><p>Edelman and his colleague, Joseph Gally, called degeneracy a \"ubiquitous biological property ... a feature of complexity\", claiming it was an inevitable outcome of natural selection. It explains both why unusual brain conditions are not as catastrophic as they might be, and also why scientists find the brain so confounding to try and understand.</p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em>.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\">Google+</a> page, or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-18T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Can you live a normal life with half a brain?","HeadlineShort":"Can you live with half a brain?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A few extreme cases show that people can be missing large chunks of their brains with no significant ill-effect – why?

Win on roulette and your chances of winning again aren't more or less &ndash; they stay exactly the same. But something in human psychology resists this fact, and people often place money on the premise that streaks of luck will continue &ndash; the so called 'hot hand'.</p><p>The opposite superstition is to bet that a streak has to end, in the false belief that independent events of chance must somehow even out. This is known as the gambler's fallacy, and achieved notoriety at the Casino de Monte-Carlo on 18 August 1913. The ball fell on black 26 times in a row, and as the streak lengthened gamblers lost millions betting on red, believing that the chances changed with the length of the run of blacks.</p><p>Why do people act this way time and time again? We can discover intriguing insights, it seems, by recruiting monkeys and getting them to gamble too. If these animals make dumb choices like us, perhaps it could tell us more about ourselves.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hryhz\"}}</p><p>First though, let&rsquo;s look at what makes some games particularly likely to trigger these effects. Many results in games are based on a skill element, so it makes reasonable sense to bet, for instance, that a top striker like Lionel Messi is more likely to score a goal than a low-scoring defender.</p><p>Yet plenty of games contain randomness. For truly random events like roulette or the lottery, there is no force which makes clumps more or less likely to continue. Consider coin tosses: if you have tossed 10 heads in a row your chance of throwing another heads is still 50:50 (although, of course, at the point before you've thrown any, the overall odds of throwing 10 in a row is still minuscule).</p><p>The hot hand and gambler&rsquo;s fallacies both show that we tend to have an unreasonable faith in the non-randomness of the universe, as if we can't quite believe that those coins (or roulette wheels, or playing cards) really are due to the same chances on each flip, spin or deal.</p><p>It's a result that sometimes makes us sneer at the irrationality of human psychology. But that conclusion may need revising.</p><p><strong>Cross-species gambling</strong></p><p>An experiment reported by Tommy Blanchard of the University of Rochester in New York State, and colleagues, shows that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25545977\">monkeys playing a gambling game are swayed by the same hot hand bias as humans</a>. Their experiments involved three monkeys controlling a computer display with their eye-movements &ndash; indicating their choices by shifting their gaze left or right. In the experiment they were given two options, only one of which delivered a reward. When the correct option was random &ndash; the same 50:50 chance as a coin flip &ndash; the monkeys still had a tendency to select the previously winning option, as if luck should continue, clumping together in streaks.</p><p>The reason the result is so interesting is that monkeys aren't taught probability theory as school. They never learn theories of randomness, or pick up complex ideas about chance events. The monkey's choices must be based on some more primitive instincts about how the world works &ndash; they can't be displaying irrational beliefs about probability, because they cannot have false beliefs, in the way humans can, about how luck works. Yet they show the same bias.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hryjf\"}}</p><p>What's going on, <a href=\"http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138%2808%2900121-9/abstract\">the researchers argue</a>, is that it&rsquo;s usually beneficial to behave in this manner. In most of life, chains of success or failure are linked for good reason &ndash; some days you really do have your eye on your tennis serve, or everything goes wrong with your car on the same day because the mechanics of the parts are connected. In these cases, the events reflect an underlying reality, and one you can take advantage of to predict what happens next. An example that works well for the monkeys is food. Finding high-value morsels like ripe food is a chance event, but also one where each instance isn't independent. If you find one fruit on a tree the chances are that you'll find more.</p><p>The wider lesson for students of human nature is that we shouldn't be quick to call behaviours irrational. Sure, belief in the hot hand might make you bet wrong on a series of coin flips, or worse, lose a pot of money. But it may be that across the timespan in evolution, thinking that luck comes in clumps turned out to be useful more often than it was harmful.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20150106-how-to-nap-like-a-pro&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2g%2Fdj%2Fp02gdj02.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em>.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-01-28T10:27:21Z","HeadlineLong":"Why we gamble like monkeys","HeadlineShort":"Why we gamble like monkeys","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often make stupid choices when gambling, says Tom Stafford, but if you look at how monkeys act in the same situation, maybe there’s good reason.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"We often make stupid choices when gambling, says Tom Stafford, but if you look at how monkeys act in the same situation, maybe there’s good reason.","SummaryShort":"The root of our poor judgements","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-01-28T10:27:21Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"bd7b656c-36de-4eec-9249-be81cf4c954b","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150127-why-we-gamble-like-monkeys","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-01-28T10:27:21Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150127-why-we-gamble-like-monkeys"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150127-why-we-gamble-like-monkeys","_id":"55dc57fb4cfb5a40c5f2b546"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>It is a common misconception that we know our own minds. As I move around the world, walking and talking, I experience myself thinking thoughts. \"What shall I have for lunch?\", I ask myself. Or I think, \"I wonder why she did that?\" and try and figure it out. It is natural to assume that this experience of myself is a complete report of my mind. It is natural, but wrong.</p><p>There's an under-mind, all psychologists agree &ndash; an unconscious which does a lot of the heavy lifting in the process of thinking. If I ask myself what is the capital of France the answer just comes to mind &ndash; Paris! If I decide to wiggle my fingers, they move back and forth in a complex pattern that I didn't consciously prepare, but which was delivered for my use by the unconscious.</p><p>The big debate in psychology is exactly what is done by the unconscious, and what requires conscious thought. Or to use the title of a notable paper on the topic, '<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1616173\">Is the unconscious smart or dumb?</a>' One popular view is that the unconscious can prepare simple stimulus-response actions, deliver basic facts, recognise objects and carry out practised movements. Complex cognition involving planning, logical reasoning and combining ideas, on the other hand, requires conscious thought.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02k6swh\"}}</p><p>A recent experiment by a team from Israel scores points against this position. <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/48/19614.abstract\">Ran Hassin and colleagues</a> used a neat visual trick called <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Continuous Flash Suppression</span> to put information into participants&rsquo; minds without them becoming consciously aware of it. It might sound painful, but in reality it&rsquo;s actually quite simple. The technique takes advantage of the fact that we have two eyes and our brain usually attempts to fuse the two resulting images into a single coherent view of the world. Continuous Flash Suppression uses light-bending glasses to show people different images in each eye. One eye gets a rapid succession of brightly coloured squares which are so distracting that when genuine information is presented to the other eye, the person is not immediately consciously aware of it. In fact, it can take several seconds for something that is in theory perfectly visible to reach awareness (unless you close one eye to cut out the flashing squares, then you can see the 'suppressed' image immediately).</p><p>Hassin&rsquo;s key experiment involved presenting arithmetic questions unconsciously. The questions would be things like \"9 - 3 - 4 = \" and they would be followed by the presentation, fully visible, of a target number that the participants were asked to read aloud as quickly as possible. The target number could either be the right answer to the arithmetic question (so, in this case, \"2\") or a wrong answer (for instance, \"1\"). The amazing result is that participants were significantly quicker to read the target number if it was the right answer rather than a wrong one. This shows that the equation had been processed and solved by their minds &ndash; even though they had no conscious awareness of it &ndash; meaning they were primed to read the right answer quicker than the wrong one.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02k6sy6\"}}</p><p>The result suggests that the unconscious mind has more sophisticated capacities than many have thought. Unlike other tests of non-conscious processing, this wasn&rsquo;t an automatic response to a stimulus &ndash; it required a precise answer following the rules of arithmetic, which you might have assumed would only come with deliberation. The report calls the technique used \"a game changer in the study of the unconscious\", arguing that \"unconscious processes can perform every fundamental, basic-level function that conscious processes can perform\".</p><p>These are strong claims, and the authors acknowledge that there is much work to do as we start to explore the power and reach of our unconscious minds. Like icebergs, most of the operation of our minds remains out of sight. Experiments like this give a glimpse below the surface.</p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em>.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-18T11:03:11Z","HeadlineLong":"Your subconscious is smarter than you might think","HeadlineShort":"How smart is your subconscious?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We feel that we are in control when our brains figure out puzzles or read words, says Tom Stafford, but a new experiment shows just how much work is going on underneath the surface of our conscious minds.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"We feel that we are in control, but a new experiment shows just how much work is going on underneath the surface of our conscious minds.","SummaryShort":"It’s cleverer than you might think","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-02-18T11:03:11Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"ee6b9712-375b-4d58-8c83-6a436c934572","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150217-how-smart-is-your-subconscious","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-02-18T11:03:11Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150217-how-smart-is-your-subconscious"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150217-how-smart-is-your-subconscious","_id":"55dc58024cfb5a40c5f2b8ac"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>We all resist changing our beliefs about the world, but what happens when some of those beliefs are based on misinformation? Is there a right way to correct someone when they believe something that's wrong?</p><p>Stephen Lewandowsky and John Cook set out to review the science on this topic, and even carried out a few experiments of their own. This effort led to their \"<a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-now-freely-available-download.html\">Debunker's Handbook</a>\", which gives practical, evidence-based techniques for correcting misinformation about, say, climate change or evolution. Yet the findings apply to any situation where you find the facts are falling on deaf ears.</p><p>The first thing their review turned up is the importance of &ldquo;<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2/fulltext.html\">backfire effects</a>&rdquo; - when telling people that they are wrong only strengthens their belief. In one experiment, for example, researchers gave people newspaper corrections that contradicted their views and politics, on topics ranging from tax reform to the existence of weapons of mass destruction. The corrections were not only ignored &ndash; they entrenched people&rsquo;s pre-existing positions.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02bqh40\"}}</p><p>Backfire effects pick up strength when you have no particular reason to trust the person you are talking to. This perhaps explains why climate sceptics with more scientific education tend to be the most sceptical that humans are causing global warming.</p><p>The irony is that understanding backfire effects requires that we debunk a false understanding of our own. Too often, argue Lewandowsky and Cook, communicators assume a 'deficit model' in their interactions with the misinformed. This is the idea that we have the right information, and all we need to do to make people believe is to somehow \"fill in\" the deficit in other people's understanding. Just telling people the evidence for the truth will be enough to replace their false beliefs. Beliefs don't work like that.</p><p>Psychological factors affect how we process information &ndash; such as what we already believe, who we trust and how we remember. Debunkers need to work with this, rather than against if they want the best chance of being believed.</p><p>The most important thing is to provide an alternative explanation. An <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/20/6/1420/\">experiment by Hollryn Johnson and Colleen Seifert</a>, shows how to persuade people better. These two psychologists recruited participants to listen to news reports about a fictional warehouse fire, and then answer some comprehension questions.</p><p>Some of the participants were told that the fire was started by a short circuit in a closet near some cylinders containing potentially explosive gas. Yet when this information was corrected &ndash; by saying the closet was empty &ndash; they still clung to the belief.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02bqh10\"}}</p><p>A follow-up experiment showed the best way to effectively correct such misinformation. The follow-up was similar to the first experiment, except that it involved participants who were given <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/20/6/1420/\">a plausible alternative explanation</a>: that evidence was found that arson caused the fire. It was only those who were given a plausible alternative that were able to let go of the misinformation about the gas cylinders.</p><p>Lewandowsky and Cook argue that experiments like these show the dangers of arguing against a misinformed position. If you try and debunk a myth, you may end up reinforcing that belief, strengthening the misinformation in people's mind without making the correct information take hold.</p><p>What you must do, they argue, is to start with the plausible alternative (that obviously you believe is correct). If you must mention a myth, you should mention this second, and only after clearly warning people that you're about to discuss something that isn't true.</p><p>This debunking advice is also worth bearing in mind if you find yourself clinging to your own beliefs in the face of contradictory facts.

But is there ever a downside to believing our own lies?</p><p>An <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/108/Supplement_3/15655.short\">ingenious study</a> by Zoe Chance of Yale University tested the idea, by watching what happens when people cheat on tests.</p><p>Chance and colleagues ran experiments which involved asking students to answer IQ and general knowledge questions. Half the participants were given a copy of the test paper which had &ndash; apparently in error &ndash; been printed with the answers listed at the bottom. This meant they had to resist the temptation to check or improve their answers against the real answers as they went along.</p><p><strong>Irresistible shortcut<br /> </strong><br /> As you'd expect, some of these participants couldn&rsquo;t help but cheat. Collectively, the group that had access to the answers performed better on the tests than participants who didn't &ndash; even though both groups of participants were selected at random from students at the same university, so were, on average, of similar ability. &nbsp;(We can't know for sure who was cheating &ndash; probably some of the people who had answers would have got high scores even without the answers &ndash; but it means that the average performance in the group was partly down to individual smarts, and partly down to having the answers at hand.)</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ktlms\"}}</p><p>The crucial question for Chance's research was this: did people in the &ldquo;cheater&rdquo; group know that they'd been relying on the answers? Or did they attribute their success in the tests solely to their own intelligence?</p><p>The way the researchers tested this was to ask the students to predict how well they'd do on a follow-up test. They were allowed to quickly glance over the second test sheet so that they could see that it involved the same kind of questions &ndash; and, importantly, that no answers had been mistakenly been printed at the bottom this time. The researchers reasoned that if the students who had cheated realised that cheating wasn&rsquo;t an option the second time around, they should predict they wouldn't do as well on this second test.</p><p>Not so. Self-deception won the day. The people who'd had access to the answers predicted, on average, that they'd get higher scores on the follow-up &ndash; equivalent to giving them something like a 10-point IQ boost. When tested, of course, they scored far lower.</p><p>The researchers ran another experiment to check that the effect was really due to the cheaters&rsquo; inflated belief in their own abilities. In this experiment, students were offered a cash reward for accurately predicting their scores on the second test. Sure enough, those who had been given the opportunity to cheat overestimated their ability and lost out &ndash; earning 20% less than the other students.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02ktlmq\"}}</p><p>The implication is that people in Chance's experiment &ndash; people very much like you and me &ndash; had tricked themselves into <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131125-why-the-stupid-say-theyre-smart\">believing they were smarter than they were</a>. There may be benefits from doing this &ndash; confidence, satisfaction, or more easily gaining the trust of others &ndash; but there are also certainly disadvantages. Whenever circumstances change and you need to accurately predict how well you'll do, it can cost to believe you're better than you are.</p><p>That self-deception has its costs has some interesting implications. Morally, most of us would say that self-deception is wrong. But aside from whether self-deception is undesirable, we should expect it to be present in all of us to some degree (because of the benefits), but to be limited as well (because of the costs).</p><p>Self-deception isn't something that is always better in larger doses &ndash; there must be an amount of it for which the benefits outweigh the costs, most of the time. We're probably all self-deceiving to some degree. The irony being, because it is self-deception, we can't know how often.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</p><p><strong>Read more:<br /> </strong></em><br /> <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131125-why-the-stupid-say-theyre-smart\">{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p01m5gph\"}}</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20131125-why-the-stupid-say-theyre-smart\">The more inept you are the smarter you think you are</a></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Neuroscience and the psychology of the everyday.

Clever, and funny too. Of course you are, just like me. But wouldn't it be terrible if we were mistaken? Psychologists have shown that we are more likely to be blind to our own failings than perhaps we realise. This could explain why some incompetent people are so annoying, and also inject a healthy dose of humility into our own sense of self-regard.</p><p>In 1999, Justin Kruger and David Dunning, from Cornell University, New York, tested whether people who lack the skills or abilities for something are also more likely to lack awareness of their lack of ability. At the start of <a href=\"https://www.math.ucdavis.edu/~suh/metacognition.pdf\">their research paper</a> they cite a Pittsburgh bank robber called McArthur Wheeler as an example, who was arrested in 1995 shortly after robbing two banks in broad daylight without wearing a mask or any other kind of disguise. When police showed him the security camera footage, he protested \"But I wore the juice\". The hapless criminal believed that if you rubbed your face with lemon juice you would be invisible to security cameras.</p><p>Kruger and Dunning were interested in testing another kind of laughing matter. They asked professional comedians to rate 30 jokes for funniness. Then, 65 undergraduates were asked to rate the jokes too, and then ranked according to how well their judgements matched those of the professionals. They were also asked how well they thought they had done compared to the average person.</p><p>As you might expect, most people thought their ability to tell what was funny was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_wobegon_effect\">above average</a>. The results were, however, most interesting when split according to how well participants performed. Those slightly above average in their ability to rate jokes were highly accurate in their self-assessment, while those who actually did the best tended to think they were only slightly above average. Participants who were least able to judge what was funny (at least according to the professional comics) were also least able to accurately assess their own ability<strong>.</strong></p><p>This finding was not a quirk of trying to measure subjective sense of humour. The researchers repeated the experiment, only this time with tests of logical reasoning and grammar. These disciplines have defined answers, and in each case they found the same pattern: those people who performed the worst were also the worst in estimating their own aptitude. In all three studies, those whose performance put them in the lowest quarter massively overestimated their own abilities by rating themselves as above average.</p><p>It didn&rsquo;t even help the poor performers to be given a benchmark. In a later study, the most incompetent participants still failed to realise they were bottom of the pack even when given feedback on the performance of others.</p><p>Kruger and Dunning's interpretation is that accurately assessing skill level relies on some of the same core abilities as actually performing that skill, so the least competent suffer a double deficit. Not only are they incompetent, but they lack the mental tools to judge their own incompetence.</p><p>In a key final test, Kruger and Dunning trained a group of poor performers in logical reasoning tasks. This improved participants&rsquo; self-assessments, suggesting that ability levels really did influence self-awareness.</p><p>Other research has shown that this \"unskilled and unaware of it\" effect holds in real-life situations, not just in abstract laboratory tests. For example, hunters who know the least about firearms also have the most inaccurate view of their firearm knowledge, and doctors with the worst patient-interviewing skills are the <a href=\"http://psy.mq.edu.au/vision/~peterw/corella/237/incompetence.pdf\">least likely to recognise their inadequacies</a>.</p><p>What has become known as the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning_Kruger\">Dunning-Kruger effect</a> is an example of what psychologists call metacognition &ndash; thinking about thinking. It&rsquo;s also something that should give us all pause for thought. The effect might just explain the apparently baffling self belief of some of your friends and colleagues. But before you start getting too smug, just remember one thing.

Maybe too much, if the wrong person is watching. We think, for instance, that the way people walk can influence the likelihood of an attack by a stranger. But we also think that their walking style can be altered to reduce the chances of being targeted.</p><p>A small number of criminals commit most of the crimes, and the crimes they commit are spread unevenly over the population: some unfortunate individuals seem to be picked out repeatedly by those intent on violent assault. Back in the 1980s, two psychologists from New York, Betty Grayson and Morris Stein, set out to find out <a href=\"http://www.scribd.com/doc/35330362/Attracting-Assault-Victims-Nonverbal-Cues-Grayson-Stein\">what criminals look for in potential victims</a>. They filmed short clips of members of the public walking along New York's streets, and then took those clips to a large East Coast prison. They showed the tapes to 53 violent inmates with convictions for crimes on strangers, ranging from assault to murder, and asked them how easy each person would be to attack.</p><p>The prisoners made very different judgements about these notional victims. Some were consistently rated as easier to attack, as an \"easy rip-off\". There were some expected differences, in that women were rated as easier to attack than men, on average, and older people as easier targets than the young. But even among those you&rsquo;d expect to be least easy to assault, the subgroup of young men, there were some individuals who over half the prisoners rated at the top end of the \"ease of assault\" scale (a 1, 2 or 3, on the 10 point scale).</p><p>The researchers then asked professional dancers to analyse the clips using a system called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laban_Movement_Analysis\">Laban movement analysis</a> &ndash; a system used by dancers, actors and others to describe and record human movement in detail. They rated the movements of people identified as victims as subtly less coordinated than those of non-victims.</p><p>Although Professors Grayson and Stein identified movement as the critical variable in criminals' predatory decisions, their study had the obvious flaw that their films contained lots of other potentially relevant information: the clothes the people wore, for example, or the way they held their heads. Two decades later, a research group led by Lucy Johnston of the University of Canterbury, in New Zealand, performed a more robust test of the idea.</p><p>The group used a technique called the <a href=\"http://www.biomotionlab.ca/Demos/BMLwalker.html\">point light walker</a>. This is a video recording of a person made by attaching lights or reflective markers to their joints while they wear a black body suit. When played back you can see pure movement shown in the way their joints move, without being able to see any of their features or even the limbs that connect their joints.</p><p>Research with point light walkers has shown that we can read characteristics from joint motion, such as gender or mood. This makes sense, if you think for a moment of times you've recognised a person from a distance, long before you were able to make out their face. Using this technique, the researchers showed that even when all other information was removed, <a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023%2FA%3A1020744915533\">some individuals still get picked out as more likely to be victims</a> of assault than others, meaning these judgements must be based on how they move.</p><p><strong>Walk this way</strong></p><p>But the most impressive part of Johnston&rsquo;s investigations came next, when she asked whether it was possible to <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1559-1816.2004.tb02559.x/abstract\">change the way we walk so as to appear less vulnerable</a>. A first group of volunteers were filmed walking before and after doing a short self defence course. Using the point-light technique, their walking styles were rated by volunteers (not prisoners) for vulnerability. Perhaps surprisingly, the self-defence training didn't affect the walkers&rsquo; ratings.</p><p>In a second experiment, recruits were given training in how to walk, specifically focusing on the aspects which the researchers knew affected how vulnerable they appeared: factors affecting the synchrony and energy of their movement. This led to a significant drop in all the recruits' vulnerability ratings, which was still in place when they were re-tested a month later.</p><p>There is school of thought that the brain only exists to control movement. So perhaps we shouldn't be surprised that how we move can give a lot away. It's also not surprising that other people are able to read our movements, whether it is in judging whether we will <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/are-classical-music-competitions-judged-on-looks-17298\">win a music competition</a>, or whether we are <a href=\"http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/news/poker-players-arms-give-away-their-hands.html\">bluffing at poker</a>.

But does giving reasons always make things clearer, or could it sometimes distract us from our true feelings?</p><p>One answer came from a study led by <a href=\"http://psp.sagepub.com/content/19/3/331.abstract\">psychology professor Timothy Wilson</a> at the University of Virginia, which asked university students to report their feelings, either with or without being asked to provide reasons. What they found revealed just how difficult it can be to reliably discern our feelings when justifying our decisions.</p><p>Participants were asked to evaluate five posters of the kind that students might put up in their bedrooms. Two of the posters were of art &ndash; one was Monet's water lilies, the other Van Gogh's irises. The other three posters were a cartoon of animals in a balloon and two posters of photographs of cats with funny captions.</p><p>All the students had to evaluate the posters, but half the participants were asked to provide reasons for liking or disliking them. (The other half were asked why they chose their degree subject as a control condition.) After they had provided their evaluations the participants were allowed to choose a poster to take home.</p><p>So what happened? The control group rated the art posters positively (an average score of around 7 out of 9) and they felt pretty neutral about the humorous posters (an average score of around 4 out of 9). When given a choice of one poster to take home, 95% of them chose one of the art posters. No surprises there, the experimenters had already established that in general most students preferred the art posters.</p><p>But the group of students who had to give reasons for their feelings acted differently. This &ldquo;reasons&rdquo; group liked the art posters less (averaging about 6 out of 9) and the humorous posters more (about 5 to 6 out of 9). Most of them still chose an art poster to take home, but it was a far lower proportion &ndash; 64% &ndash; than the control group. That means people in this group were about seven times more likely to take a humorous poster home compared with the control group.</p><p>Here&rsquo;s the twist. Some time after the tests, at the end of the semester, the researchers rang each of the participants and asked them questions about the poster they'd chosen: Had they put it up in their room? Did they still have it? How did they feel about it? How much would they be willing to sell it for? The &ldquo;reasons&rdquo; group were less likely to have put their poster up, less likely to have kept it up, less satisfied with it on average and were willing to part with it for a smaller average amount than the control group. Over time their reasons and feelings had shifted back in line with those of the control group &ndash; they didn't like the humorous posters they had taken home, and so were less happy about their choice.</p><p><strong>Trivial pursuit</strong></p><p>The source of this effect, according to the researchers, is that when prompted to give reasons the participants focused on things that were easy to verbalise; they focused on the bright colours, or funny content of the humorous posters. It's less easy to say exactly what's pleasing about the more complex art classics. This was out of step with their feelings, so in the heat of the moment participants adjusted their feelings (a process I've written about before, called <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20130312-why-we-act-against-our-beliefs\">cognitive dissonance</a>). After having the posters on their wall, the participants realised that they really did prefer the art posters all along.</p><p>The moral of the story isn&rsquo;t that intuition is better than reason. We all know that in some situations our feelings are misleading and it is better to think about what we're doing. But this study shows the reverse &ndash; in some situations introspection can interfere with using our feelings as a reliable guide to what we should do.</p><p>And this has consequences in adulthood, where the notion of expertise can mean struggling to discern when introspection is the best strategy. The researchers who carried out this study suggest that the distorting effect of reason-giving is most likely to occur in situations where people aren't experts &ndash; most of the students who took part in the study didn't have a lot of experience of thinking or talking about art. When experts are asked to give reasons for their feelings, research has found that their feelings aren&rsquo;t <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022103189900292\">distorted in the same way</a> &ndash; their intuitions and explicit reasoning are in sync.</p><p>You might also see the consequences of this regularly in your line of work. Everybody knows that the average business meeting will spend the most time discussing <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law_of_triviality\">trivial things</a>, an effect driven by the ease with which each member of the meeting can chip in about something as inconsequential as what colour to paint the bike sheds. When we're discussing complex issues, it isn't so easy to make a contribution. The danger, of course, is that in a world which relies on justification and measurement of everything, those things that are most easily justified and measured will get priority over those things which are, in fact, most justified and important.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> page or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2013-06-05T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Why we don’t always know the true causes of our actions","HeadlineShort":"Why your gut feeling may be wrong","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We can justify our decisions by how we feel, or so we believe.

As I move around the world, walking and talking, I experience myself thinking thoughts. \"What shall I have for lunch?\", I ask myself. Or I think, \"I wonder why she did that?\" and try and figure it out. It is natural to assume that this experience of myself is a complete report of my mind. It is natural, but wrong.</p><p>There's an under-mind, all psychologists agree &ndash; an unconscious which does a lot of the heavy lifting in the process of thinking. If I ask myself what is the capital of France the answer just comes to mind &ndash; Paris! If I decide to wiggle my fingers, they move back and forth in a complex pattern that I didn't consciously prepare, but which was delivered for my use by the unconscious.</p><p>The big debate in psychology is exactly what is done by the unconscious, and what requires conscious thought. Or to use the title of a notable paper on the topic, '<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1616173\">Is the unconscious smart or dumb?</a>' One popular view is that the unconscious can prepare simple stimulus-response actions, deliver basic facts, recognise objects and carry out practised movements. Complex cognition involving planning, logical reasoning and combining ideas, on the other hand, requires conscious thought.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02k6swh\"}}</p><p>A recent experiment by a team from Israel scores points against this position. <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/48/19614.abstract\">Ran Hassin and colleagues</a> used a neat visual trick called <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Continuous Flash Suppression</span> to put information into participants&rsquo; minds without them becoming consciously aware of it. It might sound painful, but in reality it&rsquo;s actually quite simple. The technique takes advantage of the fact that we have two eyes and our brain usually attempts to fuse the two resulting images into a single coherent view of the world. Continuous Flash Suppression uses light-bending glasses to show people different images in each eye. One eye gets a rapid succession of brightly coloured squares which are so distracting that when genuine information is presented to the other eye, the person is not immediately consciously aware of it. In fact, it can take several seconds for something that is in theory perfectly visible to reach awareness (unless you close one eye to cut out the flashing squares, then you can see the 'suppressed' image immediately).</p><p>Hassin&rsquo;s key experiment involved presenting arithmetic questions unconsciously. The questions would be things like \"9 - 3 - 4 = \" and they would be followed by the presentation, fully visible, of a target number that the participants were asked to read aloud as quickly as possible. The target number could either be the right answer to the arithmetic question (so, in this case, \"2\") or a wrong answer (for instance, \"1\"). The amazing result is that participants were significantly quicker to read the target number if it was the right answer rather than a wrong one. This shows that the equation had been processed and solved by their minds &ndash; even though they had no conscious awareness of it &ndash; meaning they were primed to read the right answer quicker than the wrong one.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02k6sy6\"}}</p><p>The result suggests that the unconscious mind has more sophisticated capacities than many have thought. Unlike other tests of non-conscious processing, this wasn&rsquo;t an automatic response to a stimulus &ndash; it required a precise answer following the rules of arithmetic, which you might have assumed would only come with deliberation. The report calls the technique used \"a game changer in the study of the unconscious\", arguing that \"unconscious processes can perform every fundamental, basic-level function that conscious processes can perform\".</p><p>These are strong claims, and the authors acknowledge that there is much work to do as we start to explore the power and reach of our unconscious minds. Like icebergs, most of the operation of our minds remains out of sight. Experiments like this give a glimpse below the surface.</p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em>.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-02-18T11:03:11Z","HeadlineLong":"Your subconscious is smarter than you might think","HeadlineShort":"How smart is your subconscious?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We feel that we are in control when our brains figure out puzzles or read words, says Tom Stafford, but a new experiment shows just how much work is going on underneath the surface of our conscious minds.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"We feel that we are in control, but a new experiment shows just how much work is going on underneath the surface of our conscious minds.","SummaryShort":"It’s cleverer than you might think","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-02-18T11:03:11Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"ee6b9712-375b-4d58-8c83-6a436c934572","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150217-how-smart-is-your-subconscious","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-02-18T11:03:11Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150217-how-smart-is-your-subconscious"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150217-how-smart-is-your-subconscious","_id":"55dc58024cfb5a40c5f2b8ac"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":[],"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>If I asked you to sit down and remember a list of phone numbers or a series of facts, how would you go about it? There&rsquo;s a fair chance that you&rsquo;d be doing it wrong.</p><p>One of the interesting things about the mind is that even though we all have one, we don't have perfect insight into how to get the best from it. This is in part because of flaws in our ability to think about our own thinking, which is called metacognition. Studying this self-reflective thought process reveals that the human species has mental blind spots.</p><p>One area where these blind spots are particularly large is learning. We're actually surprisingly bad at having insight into <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140917-the-worst-way-to-learn\">how we learn best</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8mrj\"}}</p><p>Researchers Jeffrey Karpicke and Henry Roediger III set out to look at one aspect: how <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5865/966.abstract\">testing can consolidate our memory</a> of facts. In their experiment they asked college students to learn pairs of Swahili and English words. So, for example, they had to learn that if they were given the Swahili word 'mashua' the correct response was 'boat'. They could have used the sort of facts you might get on a high-school quiz (e.g. \"Who wrote the first computer programs?\"/\"Ada Lovelace\"), but the use of Swahili meant that there was little chance their participants could use any background knowledge to help them learn. After the pairs had all been learnt, there would be a final test a week later.</p><p>Now if many of us were revising this list we might study the list, test ourselves and then repeat this cycle, dropping items we got right. This makes studying (and testing) quicker and allows us to focus our effort on the things we haven't yet learnt. It&rsquo;s a plan that seems to make perfect sense, but it&rsquo;s a plan that is disastrous if we really want to learn properly.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8mss\"}}</p><p>Karpicke and Roediger asked students to prepare for a test in various ways, and compared their success &ndash; for example, one group kept testing themselves on all items without dropping what they were getting right, while another group stopped testing themselves on their correct answers.</p><p>On the final exam differences between the groups were dramatic. While dropping items from study didn&rsquo;t have much of an effect, the people who dropped items from <em>testing</em> performed relatively poorly: they could only remember about 35% of the word pairs, compared to 80% for people who kept testing items after they had learnt them.</p><p>It seems the effective way to learn is to practice retrieving items from memory, not trying to cement them in there by further study. Moreover, dropping items entirely from your revision, which is the advice given by many study guides, is wrong. You can stop studying them if you've learnt them, but you should keep testing what you've learnt if you want to remember them at the time of the final exam.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8msf\"}}</p><p>Finally, the researchers had the neat idea of asking their participants how well they would remember what they had learnt. All groups guessed at about 50%. This was a large overestimate for those who dropped items from test (and an underestimate from those who kept testing learnt items).&nbsp;</p><p>So it seems that we have a metacognitive blind spot for which revision strategies will work best. Making this a situation where we need to be guided by the evidence, and not our instinct. But the evidence has a moral for teachers as well: there's more to testing than finding out what students know &ndash; tests can also help us remember.</p><p><em>Read more: </em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140917-the-worst-way-to-learn\"><em>Why cramming for tests often fails</em></a></p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"mailto:ideas@idiolect.org.uk\"><em>ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em></a>.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a>.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Psychology: A simple trick to improve your memory","HeadlineShort":"Hack your memory, learn faster","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Want to enhance your memory for facts?

It is natural, but wrong.</p><p>There's an under-mind, all psychologists agree &ndash; an unconscious which does a lot of the heavy lifting in the process of thinking. If I ask myself what is the capital of France the answer just comes to mind &ndash; Paris! If I decide to wiggle my fingers, they move back and forth in a complex pattern that I didn't consciously prepare, but which was delivered for my use by the unconscious.</p><p>The big debate in psychology is exactly what is done by the unconscious, and what requires conscious thought. Or to use the title of a notable paper on the topic, '<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1616173\">Is the unconscious smart or dumb?</a>' One popular view is that the unconscious can prepare simple stimulus-response actions, deliver basic facts, recognise objects and carry out practised movements. Complex cognition involving planning, logical reasoning and combining ideas, on the other hand, requires conscious thought.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02k6swh\"}}</p><p>A recent experiment by a team from Israel scores points against this position. <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/109/48/19614.abstract\">Ran Hassin and colleagues</a> used a neat visual trick called <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Continuous Flash Suppression</span> to put information into participants&rsquo; minds without them becoming consciously aware of it. It might sound painful, but in reality it&rsquo;s actually quite simple. The technique takes advantage of the fact that we have two eyes and our brain usually attempts to fuse the two resulting images into a single coherent view of the world. Continuous Flash Suppression uses light-bending glasses to show people different images in each eye. One eye gets a rapid succession of brightly coloured squares which are so distracting that when genuine information is presented to the other eye, the person is not immediately consciously aware of it. In fact, it can take several seconds for something that is in theory perfectly visible to reach awareness (unless you close one eye to cut out the flashing squares, then you can see the 'suppressed' image immediately).</p><p>Hassin&rsquo;s key experiment involved presenting arithmetic questions unconsciously. The questions would be things like \"9 - 3 - 4 = \" and they would be followed by the presentation, fully visible, of a target number that the participants were asked to read aloud as quickly as possible. The target number could either be the right answer to the arithmetic question (so, in this case, \"2\") or a wrong answer (for instance, \"1\"). The amazing result is that participants were significantly quicker to read the target number if it was the right answer rather than a wrong one. This shows that the equation had been processed and solved by their minds &ndash; even though they had no conscious awareness of it &ndash; meaning they were primed to read the right answer quicker than the wrong one.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02k6sy6\"}}</p><p>The result suggests that the unconscious mind has more sophisticated capacities than many have thought. Unlike other tests of non-conscious processing, this wasn&rsquo;t an automatic response to a stimulus &ndash; it required a precise answer following the rules of arithmetic, which you might have assumed would only come with deliberation. The report calls the technique used \"a game changer in the study of the unconscious\", arguing that \"unconscious processes can perform every fundamental, basic-level function that conscious processes can perform\".</p><p>These are strong claims, and the authors acknowledge that there is much work to do as we start to explore the power and reach of our unconscious minds. Like icebergs, most of the operation of our minds remains out of sight. Experiments like this give a glimpse below the surface.</p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em>.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[{"Content":{"AssetImage":[],"Campaign":null,"CollectionOverrides":null,"CollectionType":"column","Description":"Neuroscience and the psychology of the everyday.

Win on roulette and your chances of winning again aren't more or less &ndash; they stay exactly the same. But something in human psychology resists this fact, and people often place money on the premise that streaks of luck will continue &ndash; the so called 'hot hand'.</p><p>The opposite superstition is to bet that a streak has to end, in the false belief that independent events of chance must somehow even out. This is known as the gambler's fallacy, and achieved notoriety at the Casino de Monte-Carlo on 18 August 1913. The ball fell on black 26 times in a row, and as the streak lengthened gamblers lost millions betting on red, believing that the chances changed with the length of the run of blacks.</p><p>Why do people act this way time and time again? We can discover intriguing insights, it seems, by recruiting monkeys and getting them to gamble too. If these animals make dumb choices like us, perhaps it could tell us more about ourselves.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hryhz\"}}</p><p>First though, let&rsquo;s look at what makes some games particularly likely to trigger these effects. Many results in games are based on a skill element, so it makes reasonable sense to bet, for instance, that a top striker like Lionel Messi is more likely to score a goal than a low-scoring defender.</p><p>Yet plenty of games contain randomness. For truly random events like roulette or the lottery, there is no force which makes clumps more or less likely to continue. Consider coin tosses: if you have tossed 10 heads in a row your chance of throwing another heads is still 50:50 (although, of course, at the point before you've thrown any, the overall odds of throwing 10 in a row is still minuscule).</p><p>The hot hand and gambler&rsquo;s fallacies both show that we tend to have an unreasonable faith in the non-randomness of the universe, as if we can't quite believe that those coins (or roulette wheels, or playing cards) really are due to the same chances on each flip, spin or deal.</p><p>It's a result that sometimes makes us sneer at the irrationality of human psychology. But that conclusion may need revising.</p><p><strong>Cross-species gambling</strong></p><p>An experiment reported by Tommy Blanchard of the University of Rochester in New York State, and colleagues, shows that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25545977\">monkeys playing a gambling game are swayed by the same hot hand bias as humans</a>. Their experiments involved three monkeys controlling a computer display with their eye-movements &ndash; indicating their choices by shifting their gaze left or right. In the experiment they were given two options, only one of which delivered a reward. When the correct option was random &ndash; the same 50:50 chance as a coin flip &ndash; the monkeys still had a tendency to select the previously winning option, as if luck should continue, clumping together in streaks.</p><p>The reason the result is so interesting is that monkeys aren't taught probability theory as school. They never learn theories of randomness, or pick up complex ideas about chance events. The monkey's choices must be based on some more primitive instincts about how the world works &ndash; they can't be displaying irrational beliefs about probability, because they cannot have false beliefs, in the way humans can, about how luck works. Yet they show the same bias.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hryjf\"}}</p><p>What's going on, <a href=\"http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138%2808%2900121-9/abstract\">the researchers argue</a>, is that it&rsquo;s usually beneficial to behave in this manner. In most of life, chains of success or failure are linked for good reason &ndash; some days you really do have your eye on your tennis serve, or everything goes wrong with your car on the same day because the mechanics of the parts are connected. In these cases, the events reflect an underlying reality, and one you can take advantage of to predict what happens next. An example that works well for the monkeys is food. Finding high-value morsels like ripe food is a chance event, but also one where each instance isn't independent. If you find one fruit on a tree the chances are that you'll find more.</p><p>The wider lesson for students of human nature is that we shouldn't be quick to call behaviours irrational. Sure, belief in the hot hand might make you bet wrong on a series of coin flips, or worse, lose a pot of money. But it may be that across the timespan in evolution, thinking that luck comes in clumps turned out to be useful more often than it was harmful.</p><p><em>Share this story on </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dialog/feed?app_id=58567469885&amp;redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Fmodules%2Fshare%2Fclose&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.com%2Ffuture%2Fstory%2F20150106-how-to-nap-like-a-pro&amp;picture=http%3A%2F%2Fichef.bbci.co.uk%2Fwwfeatures%2F976_549%2Fimages%2Flive%2Fp0%2F2g%2Fdj%2Fp02gdj02.jpg&amp;name=&amp;description=&amp;caption=&amp;display=popup&amp;\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em>, </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/bbc_future\"><em>Twitter</em></a><em>.</em></p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em>.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2015-01-28T10:27:21Z","HeadlineLong":"Why we gamble like monkeys","HeadlineShort":"Why we gamble like monkeys","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"We often make stupid choices when gambling, says Tom Stafford, but if you look at how monkeys act in the same situation, maybe there’s good reason.","IsSyndicated":false,"Location":null,"Partner":null,"PrimaryVertical":"wwfuture","Programme":null,"RelatedStory":[],"RelatedTag":null,"StoryType":"image","SummaryLong":"We often make stupid choices when gambling, says Tom Stafford, but if you look at how monkeys act in the same situation, maybe there’s good reason.","SummaryShort":"The root of our poor judgements","Tag":[]},"Metadata":{"CreationDateTime":"2015-01-28T10:27:21Z","Entity":"story","Guid":"bd7b656c-36de-4eec-9249-be81cf4c954b","Id":"wwfuture/story/20150127-why-we-gamble-like-monkeys","ModifiedDateTime":"2015-01-28T10:27:21Z","Project":"wwfuture","Slug":"20150127-why-we-gamble-like-monkeys"},"Urn":"urn:pubstack:jative:story:wwfuture/story/20150127-why-we-gamble-like-monkeys","_id":"55dc57fb4cfb5a40c5f2b546"},{"Content":{"AssetCustom":"","AssetIbroadcast":null,"AssetImage":[],"AssetImagePromo":null,"AssetInfographic":"","AssetInline":[],"AssetSelect":"","AssetVideoIb2":null,"AssetVideoMps":null,"Author":[],"BodyHtml":"<p>How much of our brain do we actually need? A number of stories have appeared in the news in recent months about people with chunks of their brains missing or damaged. These cases tell a story about the mind that goes deeper than their initial shock factor. It isn't just that we don't understand how the brain works, but that we may be thinking about it in the entirely wrong way.</p><p>Earlier this year, a <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329861.900-woman-of-24-found-to-have-no-cerebellum-in-her-brain.html\">case was reported</a> of a <a href=\"http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/08/22/brain.awu239.extract\">woman who is missing her cerebellum</a>, a distinct structure found at the back of the brain. By some estimates the human cerebellum contains half the brain cells you have. This isn't just brain damage &ndash; the whole structure is absent. Yet this woman lives a normal life; she graduated from school, got married and had a kid following an uneventful pregnancy and birth. A pretty standard biography for a 24-year-old.</p><p>The woman wasn't completely unaffected &ndash; she had suffered from uncertain, clumsy, movements her whole life. But the surprise is how she moves at all, missing a part of the brain that is so fundamental it evolved with the first vertebrates. The <a href=\"http://bio.sunyorange.edu/updated2/comparative_anatomy/anat.html2/n_CEREBELLUM.htm\">sharks that swam when dinosaurs walked the Earth had cerebellums</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02fcm06\"}}</p><p>This case points to a sad fact about brain science. We don't often shout about it, but there are large gaps in even our basic understanding of the brain. We can't agree on the function of even some of the most important brain regions, such as the cerebellum. Rare cases such as this show up that ignorance. Every so often someone walks into a hospital and their brain scan reveals the <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12301-man-with-tiny-brain-shocks-doctors.html\">startling differences we can have inside our heads</a>. Startling differences which may have only small observable effects on our behaviour.</p><p>Part of the problem may be our way of thinking. It is natural to see the brain as a piece of naturally selected technology, and in human technology there is often a one-to-one mapping between structure and function. If I have a toaster, the heat is provided by the heating element, the time is controlled by the timer and the popping up is driven by a spring. The case of the missing cerebellum reveals there is no such simple scheme for the brain. Although we love to talk about the brain region for vision, for hunger or for love, there are no such brain regions, because the brain isn't technology where any function is governed by just one part.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02fcm1k\"}}</p><p>Take another recent case, that of a man who was found to have a tapeworm in his brain. Over four years it burrowed \"<a href=\"http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/11/510/abstract\">from one side to the other</a>\", causing a variety of problems such as seizures, memory problems and weird smell sensations. Sounds to me like he got off lightly for having a living thing move through his brain. If the brain worked like most designed technology this wouldn't be possible. If a worm burrowed from one side of your phone to the other, the gadget would die. Indeed, when an early electromechanical computer malfunctioned in the 1940s, an investigation revealed the problem: a moth trapped in a relay &ndash; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#mediaviewer/File:H96566k.jpg\">the first actual case of a computer bug being found</a>.</p><p>Part of the explanation for the brain's apparent resilience is its 'plasticity' &ndash; an ability to adapt its structure based on experience. But another clue comes from a <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/98/24/13763.short\">concept advocated by Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist Gerald Edelman</a>. He noticed that biological functions are often supported by multiple structures &ndash; single physical features are coded for by multiple genes, for example, so that knocking out any single gene can't prevent that feature from developing apparently normally. He called the ability of multiple different structures to support a single function 'degeneracy'.</p><p><a href=\"http://193.62.66.20/~karl/Degeneracy%20and%20cognitive%20anatomy.pdf\">And so it is with the brain</a>. The important functions our brain carries out are not farmed out to single distinct brain regions, but instead supported by multiple regions, often in similar but slightly different ways. If one structure breaks down, the others can pick up the slack.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02fclzb\"}}</p><p>This helps explain why cognitive neuroscientists have such problems working out what different brain regions do. If you try and understand brain areas using a simple one-function-per-region and one-region-per-function rule you'll never be able to design the experiments needed to unpick the degenerate tangle of structure and function.</p><p>The cerebellum is most famous for controlling precise movements, but other areas of the brain such as the basal ganglia and the motor cortex are also intimately involved in moving our bodies. Asking what unique thing each area does may be the wrong question, when they are all contributing to the same thing. Memory is another example of an essential biological function which seems to be supported by multiple brain systems. If you bump into someone you've met once before, you might remember that they have a reputation for being nice, remember a specific incident of them being nice, or just retrieve a vague positive feeling about them &ndash; all forms of memory which tell you to trust this person, and all supported by different brain areas doing the same job in a slightly different way.</p><p>Edelman and his colleague, Joseph Gally, called degeneracy a \"ubiquitous biological property ... a feature of complexity\", claiming it was an inevitable outcome of natural selection. It explains both why unusual brain conditions are not as catastrophic as they might be, and also why scientists find the brain so confounding to try and understand.</p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em>.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\">Google+</a> page, or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-18T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Can you live a normal life with half a brain?","HeadlineShort":"Can you live with half a brain?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A few extreme cases show that people can be missing large chunks of their brains with no significant ill-effect – why?

There&rsquo;s a fair chance that you&rsquo;d be doing it wrong.</p><p>One of the interesting things about the mind is that even though we all have one, we don't have perfect insight into how to get the best from it. This is in part because of flaws in our ability to think about our own thinking, which is called metacognition. Studying this self-reflective thought process reveals that the human species has mental blind spots.</p><p>One area where these blind spots are particularly large is learning. We're actually surprisingly bad at having insight into <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140917-the-worst-way-to-learn\">how we learn best</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8mrj\"}}</p><p>Researchers Jeffrey Karpicke and Henry Roediger III set out to look at one aspect: how <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5865/966.abstract\">testing can consolidate our memory</a> of facts. In their experiment they asked college students to learn pairs of Swahili and English words. So, for example, they had to learn that if they were given the Swahili word 'mashua' the correct response was 'boat'. They could have used the sort of facts you might get on a high-school quiz (e.g. \"Who wrote the first computer programs?\"/\"Ada Lovelace\"), but the use of Swahili meant that there was little chance their participants could use any background knowledge to help them learn. After the pairs had all been learnt, there would be a final test a week later.</p><p>Now if many of us were revising this list we might study the list, test ourselves and then repeat this cycle, dropping items we got right. This makes studying (and testing) quicker and allows us to focus our effort on the things we haven't yet learnt. It&rsquo;s a plan that seems to make perfect sense, but it&rsquo;s a plan that is disastrous if we really want to learn properly.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8mss\"}}</p><p>Karpicke and Roediger asked students to prepare for a test in various ways, and compared their success &ndash; for example, one group kept testing themselves on all items without dropping what they were getting right, while another group stopped testing themselves on their correct answers.</p><p>On the final exam differences between the groups were dramatic. While dropping items from study didn&rsquo;t have much of an effect, the people who dropped items from <em>testing</em> performed relatively poorly: they could only remember about 35% of the word pairs, compared to 80% for people who kept testing items after they had learnt them.</p><p>It seems the effective way to learn is to practice retrieving items from memory, not trying to cement them in there by further study. Moreover, dropping items entirely from your revision, which is the advice given by many study guides, is wrong. You can stop studying them if you've learnt them, but you should keep testing what you've learnt if you want to remember them at the time of the final exam.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8msf\"}}</p><p>Finally, the researchers had the neat idea of asking their participants how well they would remember what they had learnt. All groups guessed at about 50%. This was a large overestimate for those who dropped items from test (and an underestimate from those who kept testing learnt items).&nbsp;</p><p>So it seems that we have a metacognitive blind spot for which revision strategies will work best. Making this a situation where we need to be guided by the evidence, and not our instinct. But the evidence has a moral for teachers as well: there's more to testing than finding out what students know &ndash; tests can also help us remember.</p><p><em>Read more: </em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140917-the-worst-way-to-learn\"><em>Why cramming for tests often fails</em></a></p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"mailto:ideas@idiolect.org.uk\"><em>ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em></a>.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a>.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Psychology: A simple trick to improve your memory","HeadlineShort":"Hack your memory, learn faster","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Want to enhance your memory for facts?

Is there a right way to correct someone when they believe something that's wrong?</p><p>Stephen Lewandowsky and John Cook set out to review the science on this topic, and even carried out a few experiments of their own. This effort led to their \"<a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-now-freely-available-download.html\">Debunker's Handbook</a>\", which gives practical, evidence-based techniques for correcting misinformation about, say, climate change or evolution. Yet the findings apply to any situation where you find the facts are falling on deaf ears.</p><p>The first thing their review turned up is the importance of &ldquo;<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2/fulltext.html\">backfire effects</a>&rdquo; - when telling people that they are wrong only strengthens their belief. In one experiment, for example, researchers gave people newspaper corrections that contradicted their views and politics, on topics ranging from tax reform to the existence of weapons of mass destruction. The corrections were not only ignored &ndash; they entrenched people&rsquo;s pre-existing positions.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02bqh40\"}}</p><p>Backfire effects pick up strength when you have no particular reason to trust the person you are talking to. This perhaps explains why climate sceptics with more scientific education tend to be the most sceptical that humans are causing global warming.</p><p>The irony is that understanding backfire effects requires that we debunk a false understanding of our own. Too often, argue Lewandowsky and Cook, communicators assume a 'deficit model' in their interactions with the misinformed. This is the idea that we have the right information, and all we need to do to make people believe is to somehow \"fill in\" the deficit in other people's understanding. Just telling people the evidence for the truth will be enough to replace their false beliefs. Beliefs don't work like that.</p><p>Psychological factors affect how we process information &ndash; such as what we already believe, who we trust and how we remember. Debunkers need to work with this, rather than against if they want the best chance of being believed.</p><p>The most important thing is to provide an alternative explanation. An <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/20/6/1420/\">experiment by Hollryn Johnson and Colleen Seifert</a>, shows how to persuade people better. These two psychologists recruited participants to listen to news reports about a fictional warehouse fire, and then answer some comprehension questions.</p><p>Some of the participants were told that the fire was started by a short circuit in a closet near some cylinders containing potentially explosive gas. Yet when this information was corrected &ndash; by saying the closet was empty &ndash; they still clung to the belief.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02bqh10\"}}</p><p>A follow-up experiment showed the best way to effectively correct such misinformation. The follow-up was similar to the first experiment, except that it involved participants who were given <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/20/6/1420/\">a plausible alternative explanation</a>: that evidence was found that arson caused the fire. It was only those who were given a plausible alternative that were able to let go of the misinformation about the gas cylinders.</p><p>Lewandowsky and Cook argue that experiments like these show the dangers of arguing against a misinformed position. If you try and debunk a myth, you may end up reinforcing that belief, strengthening the misinformation in people's mind without making the correct information take hold.</p><p>What you must do, they argue, is to start with the plausible alternative (that obviously you believe is correct). If you must mention a myth, you should mention this second, and only after clearly warning people that you're about to discuss something that isn't true.</p><p>This debunking advice is also worth bearing in mind if you find yourself clinging to your own beliefs in the face of contradictory facts. You can&rsquo;t be right all of the time, after all.<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140521-the-best-way-to-win-an-argument\"><em></p><p>Read more about the best way to win an argument</em></a>.</p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\">@tomstafford</a> or </em><a href=\"mailto:ideas@idiolect.org.uk\"><em>ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em></a>. <em>Thanks to Ullrich Ecker for advice on this topic.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:16:19Z","HeadlineLong":"How to debunk falsehoods","HeadlineShort":"The best way to debunk myths","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Fed up with futile internet arguments, a bunch of psychologists investigated how best to correct false ideas.

Whether it&rsquo;s a school paper, university final or even a test at work, there&rsquo;s one piece of advice we&rsquo;re almost always given: make a study plan. With a plan, we can space out our preparation for the test rather than relying on one or two intense study sessions the night before to see us through.</p><p>It's good advice. Summed up in three words: cramming doesn&rsquo;t work. Unfortunately, many of us ignore this rule. At least <a href=\"http://thehawkeyeonlinenews.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/cramming-for-exams-join-the-crowd/\">one survey has found that 99% of students admit to cramming</a>.</p><p>You might think that&rsquo;s down to nothing more than simple disorganisation: I'll admit it is far easier to leave things to the last minute than start preparing for a test weeks or months ahead. But studies of memory suggest there&rsquo;s something else going on. In 2009, for example, Nate Kornell at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that spacing out learning was more effective than cramming for 90% of the participants who took part in one of his experiments &ndash; and <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.1537/abstract\">yet 72% of the participants thought that cramming had been more beneficial</a>. What is happening in the brain that we trick ourselves this way?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026v9yh\"}}</p><p>Studies of memory suggest that we have a worrying tendency to rely on our familiarity with study items to guide our judgements of whether we know them. The problem is that familiarity is bad at predicting whether we can recall something.</p><p><strong>Familiar, not remembered </strong></p><p>After six hours of looking at study material (and three cups of coffee and five chocolate bars) it&rsquo;s easy to think we have it committed to memory. Every page, every important fact, evokes a comforting feeling of familiarity. The cramming has left a lingering glow of activity in our sensory and memory systems, a glow that allows our brain to swiftly tag our study notes as \"something that I've seen before\". But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120209-why-names-and-faces-are-so-vexing\">being able to recognise something isn't the same as being able to recall it</a>.</p><p>Different parts of the brain support different kinds of memory. Recognition is strongly affected by the ease with which information passes through the sensory areas of our brain, such as the visual cortex if you are looking at notes. Recall is supported by a network of different areas of the brain, including the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, which coordinate to recreate a memory from the clues you give it. Just because your visual cortex is fluently processing your notes after five consecutive hours of you looking at them, doesn't mean the rest of your brain is going to be able to reconstruct the memory of them when you really need it to.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026vb37\"}}</p><p>This ability to make judgements about our own minds is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition\">metacognition</a>. Studying it has identified other misconceptions too. For instance, many of us think that actively thinking about trying to learn something will help us remember it. Studies suggest this is not the case. Far more important is <a href=\"http://mindhacks.com/2011/10/24/make-study-more-effective-the-easy-way/\">reorganising the information so that it has a structure more</a> likely to be retained in your memory. In other words, rewrite the content of what you want to learn in a way that makes most sense to you.</p><p>Knowing about common metacognitive errors means you can help yourself by assuming that you will make them. You can then try and counteract them. So, the advice to space out our study only makes sense if we assume that people aren't already spacing out their study sessions enough (a safe assumption, given the research findings). We need to be reminded of the benefits of spaced learning because it runs counter to our instinct to relying on a comforting feeling of familiarity when deciding how to study</p><p>Put simply, we can sometimes have a surprising amount to gain from going against our normally reliable metacognitive instinct. How much should you space out your practice? Answer: a little bit more than you really want to.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a>.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:32Z","HeadlineLong":"Memory: Why cramming for tests often fails","HeadlineShort":"The worst way to learn?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"You may think you know your own mind, but when it comes to memory, research suggests that you don't.

we gamble, something odd and seemingly irrational happens.</p><p>It's called the 'hot hand' fallacy &ndash; a belief that your luck comes in streaks &ndash; and it can lose you a lot of money. Win on roulette and your chances of winning again aren't more or less &ndash; they stay exactly the same. But something in human psychology resists this fact, and people often place money on the premise that streaks of luck will continue &ndash; the so called 'hot hand'.</p><p>The opposite superstition is to bet that a streak has to end, in the false belief that independent events of chance must somehow even out. This is known as the gambler's fallacy, and achieved notoriety at the Casino de Monte-Carlo on 18 August 1913. The ball fell on black 26 times in a row, and as the streak lengthened gamblers lost millions betting on red, believing that the chances changed with the length of the run of blacks.</p><p>Why do people act this way time and time again? We can discover intriguing insights, it seems, by recruiting monkeys and getting them to gamble too. If these animals make dumb choices like us, perhaps it could tell us more about ourselves.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hryhz\"}}</p><p>First though, let&rsquo;s look at what makes some games particularly likely to trigger these effects. Many results in games are based on a skill element, so it makes reasonable sense to bet, for instance, that a top striker like Lionel Messi is more likely to score a goal than a low-scoring defender.</p><p>Yet plenty of games contain randomness. For truly random events like roulette or the lottery, there is no force which makes clumps more or less likely to continue. Consider coin tosses: if you have tossed 10 heads in a row your chance of throwing another heads is still 50:50 (although, of course, at the point before you've thrown any, the overall odds of throwing 10 in a row is still minuscule).</p><p>The hot hand and gambler&rsquo;s fallacies both show that we tend to have an unreasonable faith in the non-randomness of the universe, as if we can't quite believe that those coins (or roulette wheels, or playing cards) really are due to the same chances on each flip, spin or deal.</p><p>It's a result that sometimes makes us sneer at the irrationality of human psychology. But that conclusion may need revising.</p><p><strong>Cross-species gambling</strong></p><p>An experiment reported by Tommy Blanchard of the University of Rochester in New York State, and colleagues, shows that <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25545977\">monkeys playing a gambling game are swayed by the same hot hand bias as humans</a>. Their experiments involved three monkeys controlling a computer display with their eye-movements &ndash; indicating their choices by shifting their gaze left or right. In the experiment they were given two options, only one of which delivered a reward. When the correct option was random &ndash; the same 50:50 chance as a coin flip &ndash; the monkeys still had a tendency to select the previously winning option, as if luck should continue, clumping together in streaks.</p><p>The reason the result is so interesting is that monkeys aren't taught probability theory as school. They never learn theories of randomness, or pick up complex ideas about chance events. The monkey's choices must be based on some more primitive instincts about how the world works &ndash; they can't be displaying irrational beliefs about probability, because they cannot have false beliefs, in the way humans can, about how luck works. Yet they show the same bias.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02hryjf\"}}</p><p>What's going on, <a href=\"http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138%2808%2900121-9/abstract\">the researchers argue</a>, is that it&rsquo;s usually beneficial to behave in this manner. In most of life, chains of success or failure are linked for good reason &ndash; some days you really do have your eye on your tennis serve, or everything goes wrong with your car on the same day because the mechanics of the parts are connected. In these cases, the events reflect an underlying reality, and one you can take advantage of to predict what happens next. An example that works well for the monkeys is food. Finding high-value morsels like ripe food is a chance event, but also one where each instance isn't independent. If you find one fruit on a tree the chances are that you'll find more.</p><p>The wider lesson for students of human nature is that we shouldn't be quick to call behaviours irrational.

A number of stories have appeared in the news in recent months about people with chunks of their brains missing or damaged. These cases tell a story about the mind that goes deeper than their initial shock factor. It isn't just that we don't understand how the brain works, but that we may be thinking about it in the entirely wrong way.</p><p>Earlier this year, a <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22329861.900-woman-of-24-found-to-have-no-cerebellum-in-her-brain.html\">case was reported</a> of a <a href=\"http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/08/22/brain.awu239.extract\">woman who is missing her cerebellum</a>, a distinct structure found at the back of the brain. By some estimates the human cerebellum contains half the brain cells you have. This isn't just brain damage &ndash; the whole structure is absent. Yet this woman lives a normal life; she graduated from school, got married and had a kid following an uneventful pregnancy and birth. A pretty standard biography for a 24-year-old.</p><p>The woman wasn't completely unaffected &ndash; she had suffered from uncertain, clumsy, movements her whole life. But the surprise is how she moves at all, missing a part of the brain that is so fundamental it evolved with the first vertebrates. The <a href=\"http://bio.sunyorange.edu/updated2/comparative_anatomy/anat.html2/n_CEREBELLUM.htm\">sharks that swam when dinosaurs walked the Earth had cerebellums</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02fcm06\"}}</p><p>This case points to a sad fact about brain science. We don't often shout about it, but there are large gaps in even our basic understanding of the brain. We can't agree on the function of even some of the most important brain regions, such as the cerebellum. Rare cases such as this show up that ignorance. Every so often someone walks into a hospital and their brain scan reveals the <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn12301-man-with-tiny-brain-shocks-doctors.html\">startling differences we can have inside our heads</a>. Startling differences which may have only small observable effects on our behaviour.</p><p>Part of the problem may be our way of thinking. It is natural to see the brain as a piece of naturally selected technology, and in human technology there is often a one-to-one mapping between structure and function. If I have a toaster, the heat is provided by the heating element, the time is controlled by the timer and the popping up is driven by a spring. The case of the missing cerebellum reveals there is no such simple scheme for the brain. Although we love to talk about the brain region for vision, for hunger or for love, there are no such brain regions, because the brain isn't technology where any function is governed by just one part.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02fcm1k\"}}</p><p>Take another recent case, that of a man who was found to have a tapeworm in his brain. Over four years it burrowed \"<a href=\"http://genomebiology.com/2014/15/11/510/abstract\">from one side to the other</a>\", causing a variety of problems such as seizures, memory problems and weird smell sensations. Sounds to me like he got off lightly for having a living thing move through his brain. If the brain worked like most designed technology this wouldn't be possible. If a worm burrowed from one side of your phone to the other, the gadget would die. Indeed, when an early electromechanical computer malfunctioned in the 1940s, an investigation revealed the problem: a moth trapped in a relay &ndash; <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#mediaviewer/File:H96566k.jpg\">the first actual case of a computer bug being found</a>.</p><p>Part of the explanation for the brain's apparent resilience is its 'plasticity' &ndash; an ability to adapt its structure based on experience. But another clue comes from a <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/98/24/13763.short\">concept advocated by Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist Gerald Edelman</a>. He noticed that biological functions are often supported by multiple structures &ndash; single physical features are coded for by multiple genes, for example, so that knocking out any single gene can't prevent that feature from developing apparently normally. He called the ability of multiple different structures to support a single function 'degeneracy'.</p><p><a href=\"http://193.62.66.20/~karl/Degeneracy%20and%20cognitive%20anatomy.pdf\">And so it is with the brain</a>. The important functions our brain carries out are not farmed out to single distinct brain regions, but instead supported by multiple regions, often in similar but slightly different ways. If one structure breaks down, the others can pick up the slack.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02fclzb\"}}</p><p>This helps explain why cognitive neuroscientists have such problems working out what different brain regions do. If you try and understand brain areas using a simple one-function-per-region and one-region-per-function rule you'll never be able to design the experiments needed to unpick the degenerate tangle of structure and function.</p><p>The cerebellum is most famous for controlling precise movements, but other areas of the brain such as the basal ganglia and the motor cortex are also intimately involved in moving our bodies. Asking what unique thing each area does may be the wrong question, when they are all contributing to the same thing. Memory is another example of an essential biological function which seems to be supported by multiple brain systems. If you bump into someone you've met once before, you might remember that they have a reputation for being nice, remember a specific incident of them being nice, or just retrieve a vague positive feeling about them &ndash; all forms of memory which tell you to trust this person, and all supported by different brain areas doing the same job in a slightly different way.</p><p>Edelman and his colleague, Joseph Gally, called degeneracy a \"ubiquitous biological property ... a feature of complexity\", claiming it was an inevitable outcome of natural selection. It explains both why unusual brain conditions are not as catastrophic as they might be, and also why scientists find the brain so confounding to try and understand.</p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em>.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\">Facebook</a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\">Google+</a> page, or message us on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\">Twitter</a>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-18T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Can you live a normal life with half a brain?","HeadlineShort":"Can you live with half a brain?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"A few extreme cases show that people can be missing large chunks of their brains with no significant ill-effect – why?

There&rsquo;s a fair chance that you&rsquo;d be doing it wrong.</p><p>One of the interesting things about the mind is that even though we all have one, we don't have perfect insight into how to get the best from it. This is in part because of flaws in our ability to think about our own thinking, which is called metacognition. Studying this self-reflective thought process reveals that the human species has mental blind spots.</p><p>One area where these blind spots are particularly large is learning. We're actually surprisingly bad at having insight into <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140917-the-worst-way-to-learn\">how we learn best</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8mrj\"}}</p><p>Researchers Jeffrey Karpicke and Henry Roediger III set out to look at one aspect: how <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5865/966.abstract\">testing can consolidate our memory</a> of facts. In their experiment they asked college students to learn pairs of Swahili and English words. So, for example, they had to learn that if they were given the Swahili word 'mashua' the correct response was 'boat'. They could have used the sort of facts you might get on a high-school quiz (e.g. \"Who wrote the first computer programs?\"/\"Ada Lovelace\"), but the use of Swahili meant that there was little chance their participants could use any background knowledge to help them learn. After the pairs had all been learnt, there would be a final test a week later.</p><p>Now if many of us were revising this list we might study the list, test ourselves and then repeat this cycle, dropping items we got right. This makes studying (and testing) quicker and allows us to focus our effort on the things we haven't yet learnt. It&rsquo;s a plan that seems to make perfect sense, but it&rsquo;s a plan that is disastrous if we really want to learn properly.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8mss\"}}</p><p>Karpicke and Roediger asked students to prepare for a test in various ways, and compared their success &ndash; for example, one group kept testing themselves on all items without dropping what they were getting right, while another group stopped testing themselves on their correct answers.</p><p>On the final exam differences between the groups were dramatic. While dropping items from study didn&rsquo;t have much of an effect, the people who dropped items from <em>testing</em> performed relatively poorly: they could only remember about 35% of the word pairs, compared to 80% for people who kept testing items after they had learnt them.</p><p>It seems the effective way to learn is to practice retrieving items from memory, not trying to cement them in there by further study. Moreover, dropping items entirely from your revision, which is the advice given by many study guides, is wrong. You can stop studying them if you've learnt them, but you should keep testing what you've learnt if you want to remember them at the time of the final exam.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8msf\"}}</p><p>Finally, the researchers had the neat idea of asking their participants how well they would remember what they had learnt. All groups guessed at about 50%. This was a large overestimate for those who dropped items from test (and an underestimate from those who kept testing learnt items).&nbsp;</p><p>So it seems that we have a metacognitive blind spot for which revision strategies will work best. Making this a situation where we need to be guided by the evidence, and not our instinct. But the evidence has a moral for teachers as well: there's more to testing than finding out what students know &ndash; tests can also help us remember.</p><p><em>Read more: </em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140917-the-worst-way-to-learn\"><em>Why cramming for tests often fails</em></a></p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch </em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/tomstafford\"><em>@tomstafford</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"mailto:ideas@idiolect.org.uk\"><em>ideas@idiolect.org.uk</em></a>.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a>.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-12-02T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"Psychology: A simple trick to improve your memory","HeadlineShort":"Hack your memory, learn faster","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Want to enhance your memory for facts?

Is there a right way to correct someone when they believe something that's wrong?</p><p>Stephen Lewandowsky and John Cook set out to review the science on this topic, and even carried out a few experiments of their own. This effort led to their \"<a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-now-freely-available-download.html\">Debunker's Handbook</a>\", which gives practical, evidence-based techniques for correcting misinformation about, say, climate change or evolution. Yet the findings apply to any situation where you find the facts are falling on deaf ears.</p><p>The first thing their review turned up is the importance of &ldquo;<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2/fulltext.html\">backfire effects</a>&rdquo; - when telling people that they are wrong only strengthens their belief. In one experiment, for example, researchers gave people newspaper corrections that contradicted their views and politics, on topics ranging from tax reform to the existence of weapons of mass destruction. The corrections were not only ignored &ndash; they entrenched people&rsquo;s pre-existing positions.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02bqh40\"}}</p><p>Backfire effects pick up strength when you have no particular reason to trust the person you are talking to. This perhaps explains why climate sceptics with more scientific education tend to be the most sceptical that humans are causing global warming.</p><p>The irony is that understanding backfire effects requires that we debunk a false understanding of our own. Too often, argue Lewandowsky and Cook, communicators assume a 'deficit model' in their interactions with the misinformed. This is the idea that we have the right information, and all we need to do to make people believe is to somehow \"fill in\" the deficit in other people's understanding. Just telling people the evidence for the truth will be enough to replace their false beliefs. Beliefs don't work like that.</p><p>Psychological factors affect how we process information &ndash; such as what we already believe, who we trust and how we remember. Debunkers need to work with this, rather than against if they want the best chance of being believed.</p><p>The most important thing is to provide an alternative explanation. An <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/20/6/1420/\">experiment by Hollryn Johnson and Colleen Seifert</a>, shows how to persuade people better. These two psychologists recruited participants to listen to news reports about a fictional warehouse fire, and then answer some comprehension questions.</p><p>Some of the participants were told that the fire was started by a short circuit in a closet near some cylinders containing potentially explosive gas. Yet when this information was corrected &ndash; by saying the closet was empty &ndash; they still clung to the belief.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02bqh10\"}}</p><p>A follow-up experiment showed the best way to effectively correct such misinformation. The follow-up was similar to the first experiment, except that it involved participants who were given <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/20/6/1420/\">a plausible alternative explanation</a>: that evidence was found that arson caused the fire. It was only those who were given a plausible alternative that were able to let go of the misinformation about the gas cylinders.</p><p>Lewandowsky and Cook argue that experiments like these show the dangers of arguing against a misinformed position. If you try and debunk a myth, you may end up reinforcing that belief, strengthening the misinformation in people's mind without making the correct information take hold.</p><p>What you must do, they argue, is to start with the plausible alternative (that obviously you believe is correct). If you must mention a myth, you should mention this second, and only after clearly warning people that you're about to discuss something that isn't true.</p><p>This debunking advice is also worth bearing in mind if you find yourself clinging to your own beliefs in the face of contradictory facts.

Whether it&rsquo;s a school paper, university final or even a test at work, there&rsquo;s one piece of advice we&rsquo;re almost always given: make a study plan. With a plan, we can space out our preparation for the test rather than relying on one or two intense study sessions the night before to see us through.</p><p>It's good advice. Summed up in three words: cramming doesn&rsquo;t work. Unfortunately, many of us ignore this rule. At least <a href=\"http://thehawkeyeonlinenews.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/cramming-for-exams-join-the-crowd/\">one survey has found that 99% of students admit to cramming</a>.</p><p>You might think that&rsquo;s down to nothing more than simple disorganisation: I'll admit it is far easier to leave things to the last minute than start preparing for a test weeks or months ahead. But studies of memory suggest there&rsquo;s something else going on. In 2009, for example, Nate Kornell at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that spacing out learning was more effective than cramming for 90% of the participants who took part in one of his experiments &ndash; and <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.1537/abstract\">yet 72% of the participants thought that cramming had been more beneficial</a>. What is happening in the brain that we trick ourselves this way?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026v9yh\"}}</p><p>Studies of memory suggest that we have a worrying tendency to rely on our familiarity with study items to guide our judgements of whether we know them. The problem is that familiarity is bad at predicting whether we can recall something.</p><p><strong>Familiar, not remembered </strong></p><p>After six hours of looking at study material (and three cups of coffee and five chocolate bars) it&rsquo;s easy to think we have it committed to memory. Every page, every important fact, evokes a comforting feeling of familiarity. The cramming has left a lingering glow of activity in our sensory and memory systems, a glow that allows our brain to swiftly tag our study notes as \"something that I've seen before\". But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120209-why-names-and-faces-are-so-vexing\">being able to recognise something isn't the same as being able to recall it</a>.</p><p>Different parts of the brain support different kinds of memory. Recognition is strongly affected by the ease with which information passes through the sensory areas of our brain, such as the visual cortex if you are looking at notes. Recall is supported by a network of different areas of the brain, including the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, which coordinate to recreate a memory from the clues you give it. Just because your visual cortex is fluently processing your notes after five consecutive hours of you looking at them, doesn't mean the rest of your brain is going to be able to reconstruct the memory of them when you really need it to.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026vb37\"}}</p><p>This ability to make judgements about our own minds is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition\">metacognition</a>. Studying it has identified other misconceptions too. For instance, many of us think that actively thinking about trying to learn something will help us remember it. Studies suggest this is not the case. Far more important is <a href=\"http://mindhacks.com/2011/10/24/make-study-more-effective-the-easy-way/\">reorganising the information so that it has a structure more</a> likely to be retained in your memory. In other words, rewrite the content of what you want to learn in a way that makes most sense to you.</p><p>Knowing about common metacognitive errors means you can help yourself by assuming that you will make them. You can then try and counteract them. So, the advice to space out our study only makes sense if we assume that people aren't already spacing out their study sessions enough (a safe assumption, given the research findings).

It's a good effort, but all it really does is replace one enigma with another mystery.</p><p>It&rsquo;s long been known that brain cells communicate by firing electrical signals to each other, and we now have myriad technologies for recording their patterns of activity &ndash; from electrodes in the brain or on the scalp, to functional magnetic resonance scanners that can detect changes in blood oxygenation. But, having gathered these data, the meaning of these patterns is still an enduring mystery. They seem to dance to a tune we can't hear, led by rules we don't know.</p><p>Neuroscientists speak of the neural code, and have made some progress in cracking that code. They are figuring out some basic rules, such as when cells in specific parts of the brain are likely to light up depending on the task at hand. Progress has been slow, but in the last decade various research teams around the world have been pursuing a far more ambitious project. We may never be able to see the complete code book, they realised, but by trying to write our own entries, we can begin to pick apart the ways that different patterns correspond to different actions.</p><p>Albert Lee and Matthew Wilson, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) first helped to set out the principles in 2002. It progresses like this. First, we record from the brain of a rat &ndash; one of our closer relatives, in the grand tree of life &ndash; as it runs a maze. Studying the whole brain would be too ambitious, so we can focus our recording on an area known as the hippocampus, known to be important for navigation and memory. If you've heard of this area before it is probably because of a famous result which showed that <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/97/8/4398.short\">London taxi drivers developed larger hippocampi</a> the longer they had spent navigating the streets of England's sprawling capital.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p024v5zc\"}}</p><p>While the rat runs the maze we record where it is, and simultaneously how the cells in the hippocampus are firing. The cell firing patterns are thrown into a mathematical algorithm which finds the pattern that best matches each bit of the maze. The language of the cells is no less complex, but now we have a Rosetta Stone against which we can decode it. We then test the algorithm by feeding it freshly recorded patterns, to see if it correctly predicts where the rat was at the point that pattern was recorded.</p><p>It doesn&rsquo;t allow us to completely crack the code, because we still don't know all the rules, and it can&rsquo;t help us read the patterns which aren't from this bit of the brain or which aren't about maze running, but it is still a powerful tool.&nbsp; For instance, using this technique, the team was able to show that the specific sequence of cell firing repeated in the brain of the rat when it slept after running the maze (and, as a crucial comparison, not in the sleep it had enjoyed before it had run the maze).</p><p>Fascinatingly, the sequence repeated faster during sleep <strong>&ndash;</strong> around 20 times faster. This meant that the rat could run the maze in their sleeping minds in a fraction of the time it took them in real life. This could be related to the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140721-how-to-learn-while-you-sleep\">mnemonic function of sleep</a>; by replaying the memory, it might have helped the rat to <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120228-why-do-we-need-to-sleep\">consolidate its learning</a>. And the fact that the replay was accelerated might give us a glimpse of the activity that lies behind sudden insights, or experiences where our life &ldquo;flashes before our eyes&rdquo;; when not restrained, our thoughts really can retrace familiar paths in &ldquo;fast forward&rdquo;. Subsequent work has shown that these <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627309005820\">maze patterns can run backwards as well as forwards</a> &nbsp;- suggesting that the rats can imagine a goal, like the end of the maze, and work their way <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v497/n7447/abs/nature12112.html\">back from that to the point where they are</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p024v72f\"}}</p><p>One application of techniques like these, which are equal parts highly specialised measurement systems and fiercely complicated algorithms, has been to decode the <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140421-inside-the-minds-of-the-dead\">brain activity in patients who are locked in or in a vegetative state</a>. These patients can&rsquo;t move any of their muscles, and yet they may still be mentally aware and able to hear people talking to them in the same room. First, the doctors ask the patients to imagine activities which are known to active specific brain regions &ndash; such as the hippocampus. The data is then decoded so that you know which brain activity corresponds to certain ideas. During future brain scans, the patients can then re-imagine the same activities to answer basic questions. For instance, they might be told to imagine playing tennis to answer yes and walking around their house to answer no &ndash; the first form of communication since their injury.</p><p>There are other applications, both <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364661314000199\">theoretical science</a>, to probe the inner workings of our minds, and practical domains such as brain-computer interfaces. If, in the future, a paraplegic wants to control a robot arm, or even <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/is-brain-to-brain-mind-control-possible-18535\">another person</a>, via a brain interface, then it will rely on the same techniques to decode information and translate it into action. Now the principles have been shown to work, the potential is staggering.</p><p><em>If you have an everyday psychological phenomenon you'd like to see written about in these columns please get in touch

There&rsquo;s a fair chance that you&rsquo;d be doing it wrong.</p><p>One of the interesting things about the mind is that even though we all have one, we don't have perfect insight into how to get the best from it. This is in part because of flaws in our ability to think about our own thinking, which is called metacognition. Studying this self-reflective thought process reveals that the human species has mental blind spots.</p><p>One area where these blind spots are particularly large is learning. We're actually surprisingly bad at having insight into <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140917-the-worst-way-to-learn\">how we learn best</a>.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8mrj\"}}</p><p>Researchers Jeffrey Karpicke and Henry Roediger III set out to look at one aspect: how <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5865/966.abstract\">testing can consolidate our memory</a> of facts. In their experiment they asked college students to learn pairs of Swahili and English words. So, for example, they had to learn that if they were given the Swahili word 'mashua' the correct response was 'boat'. They could have used the sort of facts you might get on a high-school quiz (e.g. \"Who wrote the first computer programs?\"/\"Ada Lovelace\"), but the use of Swahili meant that there was little chance their participants could use any background knowledge to help them learn. After the pairs had all been learnt, there would be a final test a week later.</p><p>Now if many of us were revising this list we might study the list, test ourselves and then repeat this cycle, dropping items we got right. This makes studying (and testing) quicker and allows us to focus our effort on the things we haven't yet learnt. It&rsquo;s a plan that seems to make perfect sense, but it&rsquo;s a plan that is disastrous if we really want to learn properly.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8mss\"}}</p><p>Karpicke and Roediger asked students to prepare for a test in various ways, and compared their success &ndash; for example, one group kept testing themselves on all items without dropping what they were getting right, while another group stopped testing themselves on their correct answers.</p><p>On the final exam differences between the groups were dramatic. While dropping items from study didn&rsquo;t have much of an effect, the people who dropped items from <em>testing</em> performed relatively poorly: they could only remember about 35% of the word pairs, compared to 80% for people who kept testing items after they had learnt them.</p><p>It seems the effective way to learn is to practice retrieving items from memory, not trying to cement them in there by further study. Moreover, dropping items entirely from your revision, which is the advice given by many study guides, is wrong. You can stop studying them if you've learnt them, but you should keep testing what you've learnt if you want to remember them at the time of the final exam.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02d8msf\"}}</p><p>Finally, the researchers had the neat idea of asking their participants how well they would remember what they had learnt. All groups guessed at about 50%. This was a large overestimate for those who dropped items from test (and an underestimate from those who kept testing learnt items).&nbsp;</p><p>So it seems that we have a metacognitive blind spot for which revision strategies will work best. Making this a situation where we need to be guided by the evidence, and not our instinct.

And the technology? Writing.</p><p>Two thousand years later, the technology has changed but the dialogue remains the same. Facebook, smartphones, and video games are all supposedly bad for us: <a href=\"http://www.theguardian.com/science/the-lay-scientist/2014/oct/03/mind-change-susan-greenfield-has-a-big-idea-but-what-is-it\">damaging our concentration, or leading to falling grades</a>.</p><p>While there&rsquo;s no doubt that information technology can have its downsides for our day-to-day behaviour, there is very little evidence that computers are damaging our brains &ndash; any more than writing made us more forgetful. In fact, computers might just make us a bit smarter.</p><p>This potential for technology to enhance the mind was explored by Google&rsquo;s vice-president of research Alfred Spector at the <a href=\"http://www.worldchangingideassummit.com/\">World-Changing Ideas Summit</a> in New York on 21 October. He outlined the ways that even simple apps could improve the way we think and learn. &ldquo;Since I was a freshman in college, almost every piece of information technology is a million times better than when I started,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And there are reasons to believe that this will affect education.&rdquo;</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0296dzf\"}}</p><p>For some enthusiastic learners, the revolution has already started: the last few years have seen a rapid rise in apps that aim to help us effortlessly absorb new material. Duolingo &ndash; an app that teaches foreign languages through playful games &ndash; already has around 40 million users, while programs like Cerego and Memrise aim to teach more general subjects, based on a growing understanding of the way the brain <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140307-how-to-learn-like-a-memory-champ\">learns and forgets information</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>But these could just be the tip of the iceberg, said Spector &ndash; if the technology will follow three important principles. Firstly, he points to research showing that even <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_2_Sigma_Problem\">average students can reach the top 2% of a class</a> if they have a personal tutor that can adapt their teaching methods to the student&rsquo;s style of thinking and learning. &ldquo;If it were the case that technology could become custom tutors, then it&rsquo;s possible to imagine enormous improvements in educational attainment,&rdquo; said Spector.</p><p>In fact, Memrise and Cerego already use this strategy to a certain extent &ndash; by tracking patterns in the ways they remember and forget the information &ndash; but more sophisticated approaches may emerge with time. In other words, we may all be able to enjoy the advantages that were once only available to the richest children.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0296f14\"}}</p><p>Spector also pointed out that designers have already mastered the way to create immersive, compelling environments &ndash; through video games &ndash; that could take the boredom out of studying. &ldquo;We have user interfaces that are so exciting that people play video games for hours and hours a day, and they could be educated by them.&rdquo; Besides adding interest, Daphne Bavelier at the University of Rochester, New York, says that by effortlessly focusing our attention, immersive environments can also <a href=\"http://cms.unige.ch/fapse/people/bavelier/wp-content/uploads/BavelierGreenPougetSchrater2012.pdf\">improve &ldquo;perceptual learning</a>&rdquo; &ndash; the kind of memory that allows you to learn a musical instrument, or a foreign language, and which normally shuts down after childhood.</p><p>Finally, Spector says that social networks could be used to increase the interaction between students. &ldquo;I learnt as much from fellow students as we do from the faculty,&rdquo; he told the WCIS audience. Indeed, part of the popularity of apps like Memrise is the fact that users can share their experiences.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0296dq1\"}}</p><p>Spector readily admits that all of this might sound a bit pie-in-the-sky at the moment, and may only attract the more dedicated users, but the obvious enthusiasm with which people are devouring apps like Duolingo suggests there is a genuine interest. &ldquo;It may be enough to get this started,&rdquo; he says. He thinks much of the necessary technology is already there &ndash; it just needs to be packaged in a more attractive way.</p><p>If so, he believes it could fundamentally change our society &ndash; perhaps even abolishing the need for schools. &ldquo;In the past it seemed you had to go to a school to get formal education &ndash; there was no choice but to go to isolated places to be educated, but now we don&rsquo;t have to do that. We may choose to but we don&rsquo;t have to.&rdquo; Or perhaps universities will cut down the number of years you spend on campus &ndash; allowing you to finish your education with distance learning. And since it means that people aren&rsquo;t all taught in one class &ndash; but offers a more personal approach &ndash; it may mean that future students can pick and choose the bits that are most appealing while avoiding the more tedious parts of their subject.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p0296j3m\"}}</p><p>Despite his obvious enthusiasm, Spector recognises that there could be some unexpected downsides to this kind of effortless learning, should it ever be achieved. &ldquo;How do we learn grit?&rdquo; he asked the audience. &ldquo;If everything is a computer game how do you learn to deal with that challenge that you spent all night trying to read Chaucer and write a summary of it?&rdquo; For many, though, that is probably a small price to pay if the easier path to learning makes us all a bit smarter, and a bit more creative.</p><p>As another speaker at the conference, Alexis Ohanian &ndash; the founder of reddit &ndash; put it: &ldquo;The internet has flattened the world&hellip; It allows us to learn anything that we want. A teenager with a smartphone has access to more knowledge than the president did a few decades ago.&rdquo;<br /> <em><br /> </em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/columns/world-changing-ideas\"><em>Discover more ideas from the World-Changing Ideas Summit</em></a></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-10-22T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"How computers change the way we learn","HeadlineShort":"Is tech making you smarter?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Can technology improve the way we learn and think?

Names, words, facts and faces &ndash; nothing is spared.</p><p>As the latest video from the Head Squeeze team describes above, mental deterioration was once thought to be an inevitable consequence of ageing, thanks to the steady erosion of our brain matter: we lose about 0.5% of our brain volume every year. The hippocampus &ndash; the region responsible for memory and learning &ndash; was thought to weather particularly badly; by the time we are 90, many of us have lost around a third of its grey matter.</p><p>Fortunately, recent research has shown that the brain is not concrete, but certain regions can adapt and grow. In 2000, a study of London taxi drivers, for instance, showed that the 4-year training of London&rsquo;s 25,000 streets showed a remarkable growth in the hippocampus compared to bus drivers who early learnt a fixed number of routes. The scientists think that, by memorising the maps of London, the brain had built many more of the &ldquo;synaptic connections&rdquo; that allow the brain cells to communicate with each other. In other words, it may be possible to train the brain to compensate for some of the neural decline that accompanies our expanding waistlines and receding hairlines.</p><p>Challenging your brain could be one way of preserving your recollections &ndash; though the value of commercial brain training apps is debatable; some experiments seem to show that while people may become a whizz at the games on their screen, the improvements fail to transfer to daily life. But other, more traditional activities &ndash; like <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24198804\">learning a musical instrument</a> or a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24959001\">second language</a> &ndash; do seem to have some protective benefits, at least on short-term recall. Ideally, it is probably best to keep your brain active throughout your life, well before you begin to approach your dotage.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25251492\">Exercise</a> and a <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25230996\">healthy diet</a> are also thought to offer some protection against dementia. As can an active social life &ndash; since regular contact with other people is also thought to excite our neurons and preserve our synapses. Ensuring that you regularly get a good night's sleep helps too.</p><p>Of course, nothing can guarantee health and vitality in old age.

His <a href=\"http://www.world-memory-statistics.com/competitor.php?id=118\">achievements included</a> memorising 2,265 binary digits in 30 minutes and the order of 16 packs of playing cards in just an hour. But at the age of 26, he was getting restless, and wanted to help others to learn like him. \"The memory techniques take a certain discipline,\" he says. \"I wanted a tool that would just allow you to relax into learning.\"</p><p>The resulting brainchild was Memrise. Launched in 2010, the website and app is now helping more than 1.4 million users to learn foreign languages, history and science with the ease of Cooke's memory powers. It has been followed by similar apps that also take the pain out of learning &ndash; both for individuals, and in schools, with some teachers finding benefits that even Cooke couldn't have predicted.</p><p>&ldquo;It's very powerful &ndash; it does all the spade work of learning,&rdquo; says Dominic Traynor, who teaches Spanish at the St Cuthbert with St Matthias Primary School in London, UK. &ldquo;I would say we've covered a year's worth of work in the first six months.&rdquo;</p><p>As Cooke first set out developing his idea, he turned to his former classmate at Oxford University, Princeton neuroscientist Greg Detre, to help update his <a href=\"http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21829181.800-old-schooled-you-never-stop-learning-like-a-child.html#.UxmyWc4YsyY\">tried-and-tested techniques with the latest understanding of memory</a>. Together, they came up with some <a href=\"http://www.memrise.com/about/\">basic principles</a> that would guide Memrise&rsquo;s progress over the following years. The first is the idea of &ldquo;elaborative&rdquo; learning &ndash; in which you try to give extra meaning to a fact to try to get it to stick in the mind. These &ldquo;mems&rdquo;, as the team call them, are particularly effective if they tickle the funny bone as well as the synapses &ndash; and so for each fact that you want to learn, you are encouraged to find an amusing image or phrase that helps plant the memory in your mind. For example, in one German language course, the word &ldquo;abend&rdquo; for evening, is illustrated with <a href=\"http://www.16kinds.com/2013/05/26/the-full-memrise-review-web-app-behind-the-scenes/\">a picture of Abraham Lincoln listening to a ghetto blaster</a>, with the caption &ldquo;Abe ends work in the evening&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s silly, but that&rsquo;s the point &ndash; an absurd image is memorable.</p><p>To cultivate those memories, the app then sets you a series of carefully timed tests over the days, weeks and months that follow. Numerous experiments over the past few years have shown that the best way to build new neural pathways is to try and <a href=\"http://www.sciencemag.org/content/319/5865/966.abstract\">recall it afresh</a>, helping subjects remember more than twice as much, over the long term, than just passively reading the material; self-testing also turns out to be <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24265738\">more effective than creative techniques</a> like drawing diagrams and mind maps.<strong></p><p></strong>Although you can find other apps designed for rote learning and drilling in this way, Memrise makes use of another trick. Detre had found that the most effective time to reactivate a memory is when you feel that it is <a href=\"http://www.gregdetre.co.uk/research/dissertation%20-%20after%20revisions%20-%20100503.pdf\">half-remembered, half-forgotten</a> &ndash; when you feel it&rsquo;s on the &ldquo;tip of your tongue&rdquo; but you can't quite reach it. So the Memrise team have designed an algorithm that predicts the arrival of that agonising state, and then springs a test on you. Since the app constantly tracks your progress, over time it becomes more accurate at predicting your learning curve, helping you surf the waves of your memory to more efficient learning.</p><p><strong>Fun learning<br /> </strong><br /> All of which may help take the pain out of learning; however, the big challenge was to make it fun too. &ldquo;We're always having to compete for your attention when you look at the screen of your phone,&rdquo; says Ben Whately, Memrise's chief operating officer. &ldquo;The experience has to have as much light-hearted interest as something like Pinterest.&rdquo; But the team have also tried hard to create a community of learners that encourages friendly competition &ndash; so users can upload their courses to share with other people looking to learn the same subject, and they can compare their rank on a leader board. &ldquo;We needed people to be comfortable to share stuff on sites like Facebook in order for it to get up and running on such a big scale,&rdquo; says Whately.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, it was the friendly competition element that captured the attention of Traynor's primary school pupils learning Spanish. &ldquo;As soon as they come into the classroom, they want to see where they are on the leader board,&rdquo; he says. And there are other advantages. Each lesson, Traynor tends to split the class into two &ndash; while half are doing the &ldquo;spade work&rdquo; on vocabulary learning on the school's iPads, he can teach the others &ndash; before the two halves switch over. By working with these smaller groups, he can then give more individual attention to each child's understanding of the grammar.</p><p>Even more powerfully, Traynor recently began encouraging his class to record and upload their pronunciation of the words onto the app &ndash; which they can then share with their classmates using the course. The sound of their classmates seems to have spurred on their enthusiasm, says Traynor. &ldquo;They're constantly trying to work out whose voice they're hearing,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;So they're giving more attention to the different sounds. I think it's improved their speaking and listening dramatically.&rdquo;</p><p>Although most courses on Memrise deal with foreign languages, teachers in other subjects are also starting to bring the technology to their classroom. Simon Birch from The Broxbourne School in Hertfordshire, for instance, uses it to teach the advanced terminology needed for food technology exams, while his school&rsquo;s English department are using it to drill spelling. \"The benefits for literacy can't be overstated,\" Birch says.</p><p>The Memrise team are now hoping to develop further features that might help teachers like Birch and Traynor &ndash; by providing them with data on students&rsquo; progress, so they can see which bits of the course are failing to stick. And following Memrise&rsquo;s success, other companies seem to be seeing the potential of applying the art and science of memory to learning apps. For instance, the <a href=\"http://www.cerego.com/\">Cerego app</a>, which launched in September 2013, also times your learning and testing to boost recall, and its team have so far launched courses on brain anatomy, music theory and art history. The team&rsquo;s preliminary tests on school students suggests that classes <a href=\"http://cerego.com/how_it_works\">perform between 20-50% better</a> using the app, and they are actively working with teachers and educational institutions to develop courses together.</p><p>So are we coming close to the relaxed, effortless learning that Cooke first envisaged? Traynor thinks so; many of his class are so hooked that they readily practice Spanish on their iPads at home, to the point that he now has to plan four or five lessons in advance. &ldquo;That's the strength of it,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The learning just doesn't stop.&rdquo;</p><p><em><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/tags/futureeducation\">Read more in the Future Education series</a>.</p><p></em><em>If you would like to comment on this video or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook page</a><em> or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/#%21/BBC_Future\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a><em>.</em></p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-03-07T00:00:00Z","HeadlineLong":"How to learn like a memory champion","HeadlineShort":"How to learn like a memory champ","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"Companies are creating learning aids that tap the science of memories, says David Robson.

Is there a right way to correct someone when they believe something that's wrong?</p><p>Stephen Lewandowsky and John Cook set out to review the science on this topic, and even carried out a few experiments of their own. This effort led to their \"<a href=\"http://www.skepticalscience.com/Debunking-Handbook-now-freely-available-download.html\">Debunker's Handbook</a>\", which gives practical, evidence-based techniques for correcting misinformation about, say, climate change or evolution. Yet the findings apply to any situation where you find the facts are falling on deaf ears.</p><p>The first thing their review turned up is the importance of &ldquo;<a href=\"http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11109-010-9112-2/fulltext.html\">backfire effects</a>&rdquo; - when telling people that they are wrong only strengthens their belief. In one experiment, for example, researchers gave people newspaper corrections that contradicted their views and politics, on topics ranging from tax reform to the existence of weapons of mass destruction. The corrections were not only ignored &ndash; they entrenched people&rsquo;s pre-existing positions.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02bqh40\"}}</p><p>Backfire effects pick up strength when you have no particular reason to trust the person you are talking to. This perhaps explains why climate sceptics with more scientific education tend to be the most sceptical that humans are causing global warming.</p><p>The irony is that understanding backfire effects requires that we debunk a false understanding of our own. Too often, argue Lewandowsky and Cook, communicators assume a 'deficit model' in their interactions with the misinformed. This is the idea that we have the right information, and all we need to do to make people believe is to somehow \"fill in\" the deficit in other people's understanding. Just telling people the evidence for the truth will be enough to replace their false beliefs. Beliefs don't work like that.</p><p>Psychological factors affect how we process information &ndash; such as what we already believe, who we trust and how we remember. Debunkers need to work with this, rather than against if they want the best chance of being believed.</p><p>The most important thing is to provide an alternative explanation. An <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/20/6/1420/\">experiment by Hollryn Johnson and Colleen Seifert</a>, shows how to persuade people better. These two psychologists recruited participants to listen to news reports about a fictional warehouse fire, and then answer some comprehension questions.</p><p>Some of the participants were told that the fire was started by a short circuit in a closet near some cylinders containing potentially explosive gas. Yet when this information was corrected &ndash; by saying the closet was empty &ndash; they still clung to the belief.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p02bqh10\"}}</p><p>A follow-up experiment showed the best way to effectively correct such misinformation. The follow-up was similar to the first experiment, except that it involved participants who were given <a href=\"http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/20/6/1420/\">a plausible alternative explanation</a>: that evidence was found that arson caused the fire. It was only those who were given a plausible alternative that were able to let go of the misinformation about the gas cylinders.</p><p>Lewandowsky and Cook argue that experiments like these show the dangers of arguing against a misinformed position. If you try and debunk a myth, you may end up reinforcing that belief, strengthening the misinformation in people's mind without making the correct information take hold.</p><p>What you must do, they argue, is to start with the plausible alternative (that obviously you believe is correct). If you must mention a myth, you should mention this second, and only after clearly warning people that you're about to discuss something that isn't true.</p><p>This debunking advice is also worth bearing in mind if you find yourself clinging to your own beliefs in the face of contradictory facts.

Whether it&rsquo;s a school paper, university final or even a test at work, there&rsquo;s one piece of advice we&rsquo;re almost always given: make a study plan. With a plan, we can space out our preparation for the test rather than relying on one or two intense study sessions the night before to see us through.</p><p>It's good advice. Summed up in three words: cramming doesn&rsquo;t work. Unfortunately, many of us ignore this rule. At least <a href=\"http://thehawkeyeonlinenews.wordpress.com/2014/06/04/cramming-for-exams-join-the-crowd/\">one survey has found that 99% of students admit to cramming</a>.</p><p>You might think that&rsquo;s down to nothing more than simple disorganisation: I'll admit it is far easier to leave things to the last minute than start preparing for a test weeks or months ahead. But studies of memory suggest there&rsquo;s something else going on. In 2009, for example, Nate Kornell at the University of California, Los Angeles, found that spacing out learning was more effective than cramming for 90% of the participants who took part in one of his experiments &ndash; and <a href=\"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/acp.1537/abstract\">yet 72% of the participants thought that cramming had been more beneficial</a>. What is happening in the brain that we trick ourselves this way?</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026v9yh\"}}</p><p>Studies of memory suggest that we have a worrying tendency to rely on our familiarity with study items to guide our judgements of whether we know them. The problem is that familiarity is bad at predicting whether we can recall something.</p><p><strong>Familiar, not remembered </strong></p><p>After six hours of looking at study material (and three cups of coffee and five chocolate bars) it&rsquo;s easy to think we have it committed to memory. Every page, every important fact, evokes a comforting feeling of familiarity. The cramming has left a lingering glow of activity in our sensory and memory systems, a glow that allows our brain to swiftly tag our study notes as \"something that I've seen before\". But <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20120209-why-names-and-faces-are-so-vexing\">being able to recognise something isn't the same as being able to recall it</a>.</p><p>Different parts of the brain support different kinds of memory. Recognition is strongly affected by the ease with which information passes through the sensory areas of our brain, such as the visual cortex if you are looking at notes. Recall is supported by a network of different areas of the brain, including the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, which coordinate to recreate a memory from the clues you give it. Just because your visual cortex is fluently processing your notes after five consecutive hours of you looking at them, doesn't mean the rest of your brain is going to be able to reconstruct the memory of them when you really need it to.</p><p>{\"image\":{\"pid\":\"p026vb37\"}}</p><p>This ability to make judgements about our own minds is called <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition\">metacognition</a>. Studying it has identified other misconceptions too. For instance, many of us think that actively thinking about trying to learn something will help us remember it. Studies suggest this is not the case. Far more important is <a href=\"http://mindhacks.com/2011/10/24/make-study-more-effective-the-easy-way/\">reorganising the information so that it has a structure more</a> likely to be retained in your memory. In other words, rewrite the content of what you want to learn in a way that makes most sense to you.</p><p>Knowing about common metacognitive errors means you can help yourself by assuming that you will make them. You can then try and counteract them. So, the advice to space out our study only makes sense if we assume that people aren't already spacing out their study sessions enough (a safe assumption, given the research findings). We need to be reminded of the benefits of spaced learning because it runs counter to our instinct to relying on a comforting feeling of familiarity when deciding how to study</p><p>Put simply, we can sometimes have a surprising amount to gain from going against our normally reliable metacognitive instinct. How much should you space out your practice? Answer: a little bit more than you really want to.</p><p><em>If you would like to comment on this article, or anything else you have seen on Future, head over to our </em><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BBCFuture\"><em>Facebook</em></a><em> or </em><a href=\"https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/107828172298602173375/107828172298602173375/posts\"><em>Google+</em></a><em> page, or message us on </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BBC_Future\"><em>Twitter</em></a>.</p>","BusinessUnit":"worldwide","CalloutBody":"","CalloutPosition":"","CalloutSubtitle":"","CalloutTitle":"","Campaign":null,"Collection":[],"DisableAdverts":false,"DisplayDate":"2014-11-18T09:12:32Z","HeadlineLong":"Memory: Why cramming for tests often fails","HeadlineShort":"The worst way to learn?","HideRelated":false,"Intro":"You may think you know your own mind, but when it comes to memory, research suggests that you don't.

the most famous experiment in neuroscience. In 1983, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_Libet">Benjamin Libet</a> sparked controversy with his demonstration that our sense of free will may be an illusion, a controversy that has only increased ever since.</p><p>Libet&#x2019;s experiment has three vital components: a choice, a measure of brain activity and a clock.</p><p>The choice is to move either your left or right arm. In the original version of the experiment this is by flicking your wrist; in some versions of the experiment it is to raise your left or right finger. Libet&#x2019;s participants were instructed to &#x201C;<a href="http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/content/106/3/623">let the urge [to move] appear on its own at any time without any pre-planning or concentration on when to act</a>&#x201D;. The precise time at which you move is recorded from the muscles of your arm.</p><p>The measure of brain activity is taken via electrodes on the scalp. When the electrodes are placed over the motor cortex (roughly along the middle of the head), a different electrical signal appears between right and left as you plan and execute a movement on either the left or right.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: Getty Images)" data-caption="You may think you are in charge of your actions, but is that just an illusion?

This clock has a single dot, which travels around the face of the clock every 2.56 seconds. This means that by reporting position you are reporting time. If we assume you can report position accurately to 5 degree angle, that means you can use this clock to report time to within 36 milliseconds &#x2013; that&#x2019;s 36 thousandths of a second.</p><p>Putting these ingredients together, Libet took one extra vital measurement. He asked participants to report, using the clock, exactly the point when they made the decision to move.</p><blockquote><p> The brain activity showed that the decision had often already been made, before the participants were aware of having taken action </p></blockquote><p>Physiologists had known for decades that a fraction of a second before you actually move the electrical signals in your brain change. So it was in Libet&#x2019;s experiment, a fraction of a second before participants moved, a reliable change could be recorded using the electrodes. But the explosive result was when participants reported <em>deciding </em>to move. This occurred <em>in between</em> the electric change in the brain and the actual movement. This means, as sure as cause follows effect, that the feeling of deciding couldn&#x2019;t be a timely report of whatever was causing the movement. The electrode recording showed that the decision had &#x2013; in some sense &#x2013; already been made before the participants were aware of having taken action. The brain signals were changing before the subjective experience of taking a decision occurred.</p><p><div class="inline-media inline-image"> <a data-replace-url="" data-anchor-title="(Credit: iStock)" data-caption="We struggle to describe our thoughts and feelings accurately, making it difficult to tell when we have made a decision (Credit: iStock)" data-caption-title="" data-replace-image="true" data-is-portrait="false" data-additional-wrapper-class="" data-is-watermarked="true" class="replace-image" title="(Credit: iStock)" href="http://ichef.bbci.co.uk/wwfeatures/624_351/images/live/p0/2y/y7/p02yy7xm.jpg"> <div class="replace-image-additional-content"><span class="icon-wrapper gel-icon-wrapper icon-wrapper-fullscreen"> <i aria-hidden="true" class="gelicon gelicon--fullscreen"></i> </span> <div class="pointer"></div></div> View image of (Credit: iStock) </a></div></p><p>Had participants&#x2019; brains already made the decision? Was the feeling of choosing just an illusion? Controversy has raged ever since. There is far more to the discussion about neuroscience and free will than this one experiment, but its simplicity has allowed it to capture the imagination of many who think our status as biological creatures limits our free will, as well as those who argue that free will survives the challenge of our minds being firmly grounded in our biological brains.</p><p>Part of the appeal of the Libet experiment is due to two pervasive intuitions we have about the mind. Without these intuitions the experiment doesn&#x2019;t seem so surprising.</p><p>The first intuition is the feeling that our minds are a separate thing from our physical selves &#x2013; a natural dualism that pushes us to believe that the mind is a pure, abstract place, free from biological constraints. A moment&#x2019;s thought about the last time you were grumpy because you were hungry shatters this illusion, but I&#x2019;d argue that it is still a persistent theme in our thinking. Why else would we be the least surprised that it is possible to find neural correlates of mental events? If we really believed, in our heart of hearts, that the mind is based in the brain, then we would know that every mental change must have a corresponding change in the brain.</p><p>The second pervasive intuition, which makes us surprised by the Libet experiment, is the belief that we know our own minds. This is the belief that our subjective experience of making decisions is an accurate report of how that decision is made. The mind is like a machine &#x2013; as long as it runs right, we are happily ignorant of how it works. It is only when mistakes or contradictions arise that we&#x2019;re drawn to look under the hood: Why didn&#x2019;t I notice that exit? How could I forget that person&#x2019;s name? Why does the feeling of deciding come after the brain changes associated with decision making?</p><blockquote><p> There&#x2019;s no reason to think that we are reliable reporters of every aspect of our minds&#x2019; contents </p></blockquote><p>There&#x2019;s no reason to think that we are reliable reporters of every aspect of our minds. Psychology, in fact, gives us lots of examples of where we often get things wrong. The feeling of deciding in the Libet experiment may be a complete illusion &#x2013; maybe the real decision really is made &#x2018;by our brains&#x2019; somehow &#x2013; or maybe it is just that the feeling of deciding is delayed from our actual deciding. Just because we erroneously report the timing of the decision, doesn&#x2019;t mean we weren&#x2019;t intimately involved in it, in whatever meaningful sense that can be.</p><p>More is written about the Libet experiment every year. It has spawned an academic industry investigating the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroscience_of_free_will">neuroscience of free will</a>. There are many criticisms and rebuttals, with debate raging about how and if the experiment is relevant to the freedom of our everyday choices. Even supporters of Libet have to admit that the situation used in the experiment may be too artificial to be a direct model of real everyday choices. But the basic experiment continues to inspire discussion and provoke new thoughts about the way our freedom is rooted in our brains. And that, I&#x2019;d argue, is due to the way it helps us confront our intuitions about the way the mind works, and to see that things are more complex than we instinctively imagine.</p><p><em>If you
