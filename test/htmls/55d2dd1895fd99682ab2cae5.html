One of my favorite items—and one the museum is exceptionally proud of—is a made-to-order sturgeon (yes, like the fish) condom. The audio guide excitedly informs me that upon initial experimentations with condoms, men had their own personal prophylactic, requiring a condom-stand for drying and special talcum powder (as well as a deft hand for rerolling before the next use).

Women who wanted to avoid pregnancy during the reign of Egypt’s Ramsses II, for example, were forced to use crocodile dung as a barrier method; it’s hypothesized that the acid from the excrement created an environment that was less than harmonious for sperm—often causing women to become septic and die from infection.
