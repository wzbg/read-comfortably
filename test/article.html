isn&apos;t true for non-marital relationships. If men and women were living together without marrying, each gender was equally likely to initiate a breakup</h2> <p>In a presentation to the American Sociological Association, researchers report that women are more likely than men to ask for divorce. But non-marital breakups are more gender neutral.</p> <p>The results came from an analysis of the aptly named &#x201C;How Couples Meet and Stay Together&#x201D; survey, collected from 2,262 adults with opposite sex partners who answered questions about their relationship status between 2009 and 2015. Women initiated 69% of divorces, compared to 31% of men. But if men and women were living together without marrying, each gender was equally likely to initiate a breakup.</p> <p>Almost all studies to date have shown that women are more likely to ask for divorce, the study&#x2019;s lead author, Michael Rosenfeld, said in a statement. An associate professor of sociology at Stanford University, Rosenfeld said that social scientists assumed that women&#x2019;s heightened sensitivities to the ups and downs of relationships would mean they were more likely to leave both marriages and non-marital unions.</p> <p>But the latest data suggests that perhaps there&#x2019;s more involved. Women may be responding to the still arcane conventions of spousal roles, which contrast with growing equality in other institutions, such as the workplace. &#x201C;I think that marriage as an institution has been a little bit slow to catch up with expectations for gender equality. Wives still take their husbands&#x2019; surnames, and are sometimes pressured to do so. Husbands still expect their wives to do the bulk of the housework and the bulk of the childcare,&#x201D; he said in the statement. &#x201C;On the other hand, I think that non-marital relationships lack the historical baggage and expectations of marriage, which makes the non-marital relationships more flexible and therefore more adaptable to modern expectations &#x2026; of gender equality.&#x201D;</p> <div class="video-wrapper brightcove-size-large" data-pos="1" data-continuous="1" data-playlist="0"><object id="bc-video-4142499802001-1" class="BrightcoveExperience"><param

Women may be responding to the still arcane conventions of spousal roles, which contrast with growing equality in other institutions, such as the workplace. &#8220;I think that marriage as an institution has been a little bit slow to catch up with expectations for gender equality. Wives still take their husbands&#8217; surnames, and are sometimes pressured to do so. Husbands still expect their wives to do the bulk of the housework and the bulk of the childcare,&#8221; he said in the statement. &#8220;On the other hand, I think that non-marital relationships lack the historical baggage and expectations of marriage, which makes the non-marital relationships more flexible and therefore more adaptable to modern expectations &#8230; of gender equality.&#8221;<\/p>\n<div class=\"video-wrapper brightcove-size-large\" data-pos=\"3\" data-continuous=\"1\" data-playlist=\"0\"><object id=\"bc-video-4142499802001-3\" class=\"BrightcoveExperience\"><param name=\"bgcolor\" value=\"#000000\"><param name=\"width\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"height\" value=\"100%\"><param name=\"playerID\" value=\"1847503743001\"><param name=\"isVid\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"isUI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"dynamicStreaming\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"videoSmoothing\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"linkBaseURL\" value=\"http:\/\/ti.me\/1NM5RAa\"><param name=\"includeAPI\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"templateLoadHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateLoad\"><param name=\"templateReadyHandler\" value=\"Time.application.brightcoveFacade._onTemplateReady\"><param name=\"wmode\" value=\"opaque\"><param name=\"htmlFallback\" value=\"true\"><param name=\"@videoPlayer\" value=\"4142499802001\"><\/object><\/div>\n","read_more":true,"section":{"name":"Living","slug":"living","url":"http:\/\/time.com\/living\/","description":"The latest news and commentary from TIME on society, relationships, parenting, sex, psychology, aging, gender, career, women's issues, marriage, love and more","living":true},"tag":{"name":"Love &amp;

thing. Now what?&#8221; I panicked. I have flown several times before but I had never flown a dog anywhere. A dog. Do they even allow animals on a plane? Turns out, people do this all time and it&#8217;s not so bad after all. So before you decide that flying your dog is both stressful and near impossible, take a deep breath and just consider these 9 simple tips. Once you&#8217;ve landed, you&#8217;ll have your pup flying first class like it&#8217;s no big deal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Health:<\/strong> First things first, make sure your dog is healthy and prepared to be exposed to a new environment. Your dog may need to have shots updated, an extra box of flea and tick medication or blood work for this process. So make sure you schedule a checkup before traveling. After all, the vet knows best!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Crate:<\/strong> If you have a medium-large breed dog, you&rsquo;re going to need a crate because they are considered a check-in and sometimes even cargo depending on how large he\/she is. Make sure your dog can stand up straight without touching the top of the crate and turn around comfortably. You can find airline approved crates at <a href=\"http:\/\/www.petsmart.com\/dog\/crates-gates-containment\/petmate-plastic-carriers-zid36-6588\/cat-36-catid-100013?var_id=36-6588&amp;_t=pfm%3Dcategory\">Petsmart<\/a> that fit your dog&#8217;s needs. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Note<\/span>: it&#8217;s best to crate train your dog a few months in advance that way he\/she is familiar with the crate.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Carry on:<\/strong> I don&rsquo;t have a toy sized dog, so both of mine were considered checked bags but if your dog meets the size qualifications, I definitely recommend keeping them at your side during the flight. It allows you to know that your dog is safe and it&#8217;s cheaper. Check out these trendy <a href=\"http:\/\/sleepypod.com\/air\">airline carriers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Comfort item:<\/strong> Just like a child needs their &ldquo;blankie&rdquo; or &ldquo;passie,&rdquo; a dog needs comfort too, especially during a flight which can cause them a load of stress. I used an old t-shirt and sprayed some of my body spray on it right beforehand. An owner&rsquo;s scent is like comfort food for a dog.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4008604\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Restrictions:<\/strong> Most flights have breed restrictions so make sure to double check before booking your dog&rsquo;s ticket. Dog breeds that aren&rsquo;t meant for the sky miles are typically snub-nosed dogs such as bulldogs and pugs. Here is a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.avma.org\/public\/PetCare\/Pages\/Short-nosed-Dogs-and-Air-Travel-FAQs.aspx\">FAQ<\/a> guide to air travel and short nosed breeds.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Thunder Shirt:<\/strong> For the extra timid pup, I highly recommend a <a href=\"http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Thundershirt-Jacket-Anxiety-Large-Solid\/dp\/B0028QK6EY\">Thunder Shirt<\/a>. It&rsquo;s designed to fit tight which allows for your dog to feel secure when he is scared. Thunder is scary but turbulence is even scarier.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Direct flight:<\/strong> If you can avoid a layover, please do. It sounds ideal for you dog to have the opportunity to get out and stretch his legs before hopping onto the next five-hour flight but it&#8217;s really not worth it. Once you&#8217;re dog is out of his crate for the first time, chances are he\/she isn&#8217;t going to want to get back in. Direct flights are a great way to minimize stress.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quarantine:<\/strong> When bringing your dog(s) into a foreign country (or back to the states), they may be subject to be quarantined. <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bringfido.com\/travel\/international\/united_states\/\">BringFido<\/a> has a great page with information and an application if it is necessary. There are also steps you can take to avoid this long and messy hassle, it just depends on where you&#8217;re going.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Booking the ticket:<\/strong> Browse before booking and book in advance. Airfare for dogs can range anywhere between, $200 to $1000 plus, depending on size and destination. I personally booked through <a href=\"http:\/\/www.delta.com\/content\/www\/en_US\/traveling-with-us\/special-travel-needs\/pets.html\">Delta<\/a> but here is a list of other <a href=\"http:\/\/www.bringfido.com\/travel\/\">dog friendly airlines<\/a>. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline;\">Note<\/span>: airlines don&#8217;t allow pets to fly during summer months due to heat.<\/p>\n<p><em>This <a href=\"https:\/\/www.avelist.com\/list\/10-tips-for-dogs-and-air-travel-18659\">article<\/a> originally appeared on <a

Ever since the South Korean company hit a bit of a rough patch early this year it&rsquo;s been looking for ways to improve its bottom line. Meanwhile, profits at the company have declined for <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/07\/07\/samsung-apple-galaxy-s6\/\">seven straight quarters<\/a>, forcing it to <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/07\/30\/samsung-price-galaxy-sales\/\">cut prices<\/a> for its Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge.<\/p>\n<p>Samsung is in dire need of a hit device to put the company back on a path towards rising profits, which is hopefully where the Note 5 and S6 Edge+ can help. For the past week I&rsquo;ve tested both devices, using them non-stop to snap photos, capture videos, and do all the things you&rsquo;d normally do on a smartphone. And you know what? These devices just might be what Samsung&rsquo;s looking for.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Design<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As noted in a previous <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/08\/13\/samsung-galaxy-note-5-s6-edge\/\">story<\/a>, the company will no longer offer smartphones equipped with microSD card slots and removable batteries and instead offer devices made from svelte aluminum and glass; much to the chagrin of its most faithful of users.<\/p>\n<p>The S6 Edge+ and Note 5 were each crafted with a different type of consumer in mind. The S6 Edge+ is for those who like to watch videos and play games thanks to the immersive experience its curved display lends itself to. Meanwhile, the Note 5, as its lineage dictates, is aimed directly at those who want a productivity device, complete with a stylus for jotting notes and sketching ideas.<\/p>\n<p>Storage options are limited to 32- or 64-gigabytes for both devices, again, with no option to add storage via a memory card. The lack of storage is a confusing omission when looking at the Note 5, a device that&rsquo;s made a name for itself as a productivity-first device.<\/p>\n<p>Is one device better than the other? It depends on how you plan on using it. I suspect the majority of users will opt for the S6 Edge+ due to its curved design. The S6 Edge+ is lighter and thinner than the Note 5, and overall just feels easier to hold.<strong><del><br \/>\n<\/del><\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Note 5 was more to difficult hold on, an issue that&rsquo;s undoubtedly a byproduct of it&rsquo;s 5.7-inch, but also an unfortunate side effect of its design (and despite the fact the back of the Note 5 is curved in a similar fashion to that of the screen on the S6 Edge+).<\/p>\n<p>The S6 Edge+ is equipped with the same screen size as the Note, and is .7 millimeters thinner on the spec sheet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Performance<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Both devices are equipped with Samsung&rsquo;s 2.1 GHz Exynos 7420 64-bit octa-core processor, which translates into a fast experience. Apps were always fast to open and close, with no discernible delay. Even after a full day&rsquo;s use of installing, loading, and customizing over 50 applications, neither device showed signs of slowing down.<\/p>\n<p>The only time I briefly experienced a slight slowdown was when using Samsung&rsquo;s multi window feature, which allows two apps to run at the same time in a split-screen orientation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Software<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When Samsung launched both devices at its Unpacked event it failed to include one word: <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/TouchWiz\">TouchWiz<\/a>. The term refers to Samsung&rsquo;s divisive proprietary software that runs atop Google&rsquo;s Android platform, adding features and customization options.<\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the omission wasn&rsquo;t an indication the company had decided to walk away from the interface. The software is still present, for better or worse, and still a hindrance.<\/p>\n<p>For example, S Voice is the company&rsquo;s digital assistant, much like Apple&rsquo;s Siri, and responds to voice commands. After summoning your personal assistant, you can ask it for weather updates or to set reminders.<\/p>\n<p>The setup process for S Voice requires you to set your own activation phrase, repeating it several times to train your device. In my case, I opted for &ldquo;Hey Edge&rdquo; to beckon its attention. Only, I rarely was able to activate it on first try. Unfortunately, many times the device had no reaction. How did I figure out if I needed an umbrella? I asked Google instead, and it responded nearly every single time.<\/p>\n<p>Compounding the frustrating experience, S Voice would randomly turn on. I can only assume the device thought that it heard my personalized &ldquo;Hey Edge&rdquo; command from something on TV or radio, and that whatever it heard did a better job at sounding like me than I did.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4008687\"><\/div>\n<p>Inconsistent experiences such as what I experienced with S Voice are found on both devices&rsquo; software. Thankfully, however, most of it can be disabled.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Camera<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Samsung put the same 16 megapixel sensor from its previous generation phones in its Note 5 and S6 Edge+<em>.<\/em>The result means performance is the same, but the larger screens make it easier to frame and setup photos.<\/p>\n<p>Samsung offers different camera modes designed for specific situations, such as sporting events or, yes, even food pics.<\/p>\n<p>Low-light performance was a weak spot, as it is with most smartphone cameras. Instead of grainy photos, however, both devices struggled with capturing the proper white balance. In comparison, the iPhone 6 offered up grainy photos with better balance.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Battery life<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Note 5 and S6 Edge+ are each equipped with a 3,000 milliamp-hour battery. The size may be a disappointment to some, given the battery is smaller than the Note 4 and no longer removable, meaning users can&rsquo;t simply replace a dead battery with a fully charged spare when needed.<\/p>\n<p>Unlike my experience with Samsung&rsquo;s smaller flagship devices, the battery life on the Note 5 or S6 Edge+ was a non-issue. I failed to completely deplete either battery throughout the day, in spite of heavy use.<\/p>\n<p>At one point I forgot to place the Note 5 on its charger before bed, and when I woke the battery was at 16%. Normally when this happens&mdash;and I think we&rsquo;ve all been there&mdash;you charge your device while you get ready for the work day, and leave the house with a half-charged battery.<\/p>\n<p>However, I plugged the Note 5 in and 15 minutes later the battery had an extra 25%; another 15 minutes later I was nearing 60%. Samsung&rsquo;s integration of Qualcomm, a quick-charging technology for devices, is an invaluable feature.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Samsung Pay<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately I wasn&rsquo;t able to test Samsung Pay on either device during the review period, but the beta is scheduled for launch <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/08\/13\/samsung-pay-launch-beta\/\">this month<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Both devices are equipped with the required hardware and&mdash;according to Samsung&mdash;already contain the software needed to use the mobile payment service once it&rsquo;s available (users will still need to download the Samsung Pay app to enable it, rather than wait for a software update as is the case for S6 and S6 Edge owners).<\/p>\n<p>If Pay works as advertised, it has the potential to be one of the increasingly rare features capable of changing smartphone use through its ability to work with both standard credit and debit card terminals and NFC readers.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Pricing<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Both devices are available starting August 21 across all four major U.S. carriers, plus U.S. Cellular. Pricing is carrier dependent, but most are offering the device at $700 for the 32GB Note 5. Full retail pricing of the 32GB S6 Edge+ is in the neighborhood of $770. Though some carriers such at AT&amp;T still provide the option to sign a two-year contract, putting the cost below $300 for either device.<\/p>\n<p>Samsung&rsquo;s latest devices carry a steep price tag in a market that&rsquo;s increasingly seeing quality Android devices hit the market at cheaper prices, and with the added benefit of no contract or monthly payments. For example, the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/08\/19\/oneplus-2review\/\">OnePlus 2<\/a>&rsquo;s most expensive model is $390, while Motorola&rsquo;s <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/07\/28\/motorola-carriers-devices\/\">$399 Moto X<\/a> will soon be available.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Note 5 vs. S6 Edge+<br \/>\n<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 Edge+ are the best Android smartphones I&rsquo;ve ever used. Their large, vibrant displays were a joy to look at. I even began to appreciate the curved screen of the S6 Edge+, a departure from the my feelings after using the <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/04\/27\/samsung-galaxy-s6-2\/\">S6 Edge<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The fingerprint reader is fast, and most importantly, reliable. The camera is one of the best I&rsquo;ve ever used on a smartphone, giving me pause each time I pulled out my iPhone to snap a photo. The battery offered enough power to get me through an entire day of heavy use.<\/p>\n<p>If I was asked to pick between the S6 Edge+ or the Note 5, I&rsquo;d be inclined to pick the former. The curved display doesn&rsquo;t offer any true advantage other than making the device easier to grip, and the Note 5&rsquo;s biggest differentiator (and only feature worth nothing) is its stylus. Outside of that, both devices offer the same software and hardware experience.<\/p>\n<p><em>This <a href=\"http:\/\/fortune.com\/2015\/08\/24\/samsung-galaxy-note-5-s6-edge-review\/\">article<\/a>

Tarantino has never been shy about sharing his opinions, and it doesn&rsquo;t look like things have changed all that much as he&rsquo;s gotten older. In an expansive new interview with <em>New York Magazine<\/em>, the 52-year-old director opened up about a wealth of topics &ndash; including his thoughts on Barack Obama, why he doesn&rsquo;t love &ldquo;these Cate Blanchett movies,&rdquo; and the phenomenon of <em>True Detective<\/em>. The full chat can be found at the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.vulture.com\/2015\/08\/quentin-tarantino-lane-brown-in-conversation.html\" target=\"_blank\"><em>New York<\/em> website<\/a>. Ahead, our five favorite moments.<\/p>\n<p><strong>He likes Barack Obama<\/strong>: &ldquo;I think he&rsquo;s fantastic. He&rsquo;s my favorite president, hands down, of my lifetime. He&rsquo;s been awesome this past year. Especially the rapid, one-after-another-after-another-after-another aspect of it. It&rsquo;s almost like take no prisoners. His he-doesn&rsquo;t-give-a-sh&ndash; attitude has just been so cool. Everyone always talks about these lame-duck presidents. I&rsquo;ve never seen anybody end with this kind of ending. All the people who supported him along the way that questioned this or that and the other? All of their questions are being answered now.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>He&rsquo;s probably not that excited about <em>Carol<\/em><\/strong>: &ldquo;The movies that used to be treated as independent movies, like the Sundance movies of the &rsquo;90s &ndash; those are the movies that are up for Oscars now. Stuff like <em>The Kids Are All Right<\/em> and <em>The Fighter<\/em>. They&rsquo;re the mid-budget movies now, they just have bigger stars and bigger budgets. They&rsquo;re good, but I don&rsquo;t know if they have the staying power that some of the movies of the &rsquo;90s and the &rsquo;70s did. I don&rsquo;t know if we&rsquo;re going to be talking about <em>The Town<\/em> or <em>The Kids Are All Right<\/em> or <em>An Education<\/em> 20 or 30 years from now. <em>Notes on a Scandal<\/em> is another one. <em>Philomena<\/em>. Half of these Cate Blanchett movies &ndash; they&rsquo;re all just like these arty things. I&rsquo;m not saying they&rsquo;re bad movies, but I don&rsquo;t think most of them have a shelf life. But <em>The Fighter<\/em> or <em>American Hustle<\/em> &ndash; those will be watched in 30 years.&rdquo;<\/p>\n<p><strong>He has put a lot of thought into what makes <em>The Fighter<\/em> better than<em>The Town<\/em><\/strong>: &ldquo;I really liked <em>The Town<\/em>, which also came out in 2010. It was a good crime film. However, next to <em>The Fighter<\/em>, it just couldn&rsquo;t hold up, because everybody in <em>The Town<\/em> is beyond gorgeous. Ben Affleck is the one who gets away with it, because his Boston accent is so good. But the crook is absolutely gorgeous. The bank teller is absolutely gorgeous. The FBI guy is absolutely gorgeous. The town whore, Blake Lively, is absolutely gorgeous. Jeremy Renner is the least gorgeous guy, and he&rsquo;s pretty f&mdash;ing good-looking. Then, if you look at <em>The Fighter<\/em>, and you look at those sisters, they&rsquo;re just so magnificent. When you see David O. Russell cast those sisters, and you see Ben Affleck cast Blake Lively, you can&rsquo;t compare the two movies. One just shows how phony the other is.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4008553\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>He can use Jay Z lyrics to underline a filmmaker diss<\/strong>: &ldquo;The last time that I felt competitive was when I was doing <em>Kill Bill<\/em> and my competition was <em>The Matrix Reloaded<\/em>. That was the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads. I saw <em>Matrix Reloaded<\/em> at the Chinese Theatre the day it opened, and I walked out of the cinema singing that Jay Z song: &ldquo;S-dot-Carter&#8197;\/&#8197;Y&rsquo;all must try harder&#8197;\/&#8197;Competition is nada.&rdquo; I was like, Bring it the f&mdash; on. I was worried about that?

<\/em>a companion series to Robert Kirkman<strong>&#8216;<\/strong>s ratings behemoth &mdash; introduced its brand new take on society Sunday with a supersized series premiere that offered the first-ever signs of humanity&#8217;s demise.<\/p>\n<p>For fans of the zombie drama and corresponding comic book, the Los Angeles-set series provided the long-awaited look at the first days of the end of the world as we know it. The premiere, written by series creators Kirkman and Dave Erickson, introduced a blended family and a terrifying new threat that many in the pilot &mdash; save for the drug-addicted eldest son Nick (Frank Dillane) &mdash; failed to wrap their heads around.<\/p>\n<p>The teen is the first to encounter a member of the undead, but his family, including his guidance counselor mother Madison (Kim Dickens) and her boyfriend Travis (Cliff Curtis), as well as younger sister Alicia (Alycia Debnam-Carey), all think he&#8217;s delusional.<\/p>\n<p>Ultimately, Nick &mdash; hospitalized after running from the sight of the undead feasting on a corpse &mdash; escapes and Travis and &mdash; eventually &mdash; Madison see for themselves that his stories of carnage at the church from hell aren&#8217;t that far off. They watch as Nick&#8217;s former friend Calvin comes back from the dead and &#8220;live&#8221; after being brutally struck by their car twice, the final time with a missing jaw.<\/p>\n<p>Here, showrunner Erickson breaks down the series premiere and takes a larger look at what&#8217;s to come this season.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How much of the decision to tell the story through the eyes of a drug addict came from wanting to prove to the audience that this is really happening and he&#8217;s not crazy?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>A lot of it. We did a version of the pilot that was a lot more accelerated. We chopped off a lot more stories sooner. I did a pass and sent it to Robert, who liked it but pitched a different character with a similar dynamic. In the original conception of the show, before I came on, the character of Nick was an addict. It seemed like an interesting window where you&#8217;re living in a world where it&#8217;s not necessarily a judgmental world and for most people, if you see someone behaving this way, your assumption is not, &#8220;That&#8217;s a zombie.&#8221; It&#8217;s that they&#8217;re sick or high and there has to be some reasonable, rational explication for it. What&#8217;s interesting is to have a character whose prism was a bit distorted. Who sees something and even when he confesses what he saw &mdash; Travis says it in the pilot with &#8220;You saw what the drugs saw.&#8221; It becomes a quest for Nick to find out if what he saw real or if it was just in his mind. Was it the drugs or did that really happen? For Nick, Travis and Madison, it just doesn&#8217;t seem possible. For us, and this is consistent with how the season will develop, the character who believes they saw something, they&#8217;re slowly dragging the other characters along to the realization that this is really happening.<\/p>\n<p>It gives us a narrative angle for the story, but it also introduces a conflict with this character and his relationship with his mother that&#8217;s something that will evolve and be explored throughout this season and beyond. When we get to a place in season two, and subsequent seasons, your addictive personality doesn&#8217;t go away and it will be interesting to see what Nick does when he&#8217;s clean. How is he going to channel that personality? There&#8217;s some great opportunities for that character.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It took Madison a bit longer than Travis to believe Nick &mdash; and seeing for herself what happened with Calvin. What do Madison, Travis and Nick do now with this information? <\/strong><\/p>\n<p>That&#8217;s episode two. You get to end of the pilot and they go through this horribly traumatic event with Calvin, who has already been shot, and then he&#8217;s run over and hit again and he&#8217;s twisted and torn in the dry L.A. River and he should be dead. The goal for us at end of the pilot was to get to a place where we validate what Nick saw. But for Travis and Madison, they&#8217;ve heard what Nick has said; Tobias had his conversation with Madison. They&#8217;ve seen the footage from the news chopper from the event that took place on the freeway. It&#8217;s starting to mesh, in a way. So when they get to that moment, they know <em>something <\/em>is wrong. They assume that it&#8217;s got to be a virus going around. They don&#8217;t go to zombie. For any parent at that point, you regress into your own and their priority is going to be not to get the word out &mdash; they could try to call 911 and that&#8217;s going to fail and we&#8217;ll discover that when we get to the end of season two &mdash; but it&#8217;s about how do we gather our family together and protect those closest to us. Then once we&#8217;ve done that, how do we explain to them what&#8217;s going on and how this is unfolding. Their goal coming after the pilot is going to be very specific and personal. The line of the season and every season that comes after is to always make it about family-driven stories and what&#8217;s specific to protecting them.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Speaking of which, Alicia doesn&#8217;t know how severe this outbreak is &mdash; and her boyfriend Matt is missing. More than anyone so far, she has her entire future mapped out and can&#8217;t wait to get away from home. How will the outbreak impact her and that she may be stuck with her family?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;ll change radically. For all that happens in the first season, we still manage to structure in a way that our family is still insulated. There&#8217;s a whole world of discovery for them to get into when we get to season two. You look at this brother-sister relationship with Nick and Alicia. Nick is already living on the fringe and has been in his own apocalypse for quite a long time, and Alicia who is in counterpoint to that. They both reacted to the death of their father six years ago in an auto wreck. They both have a fatalistic line. They&#8217;ve both had experience with death already, which will be interesting to explore as we move forward. The people who seem to have it together, who seem to be the most independent, competent and ready for anything, oftentimes are the ones who are going to suffer the greatest when it comes to the end of the world. She had a very specific narrative line mapped out for herself: she was going to get out and start a life for herself and not abandon her family but put distance between her brother and his bullshit and the co-dependent relationship that Madison has with Nick. Alicia, unlike Madison whose primary goal is to protect and save her son, she has a great bullshit detector. There&#8217;s a scene in the pilot where when he talks about getting clean, and she shuts him down. It&#8217;s a visceral reaction because she&#8217;s heard and seen him say it before and she knows it&#8217;s not true. It&#8217;s going to have to be something incredibly traumatic and violent that gets his head straight. Then the apocalypse happens and something traumatic and violent does come down the pike.<\/p><div class=\"content-ad\" id=\"content-ad-4008533\"><\/div>\n<p><strong>Alicia also was there to see the kill-shot in the video and knows what it takes to put down the undead. Will that be something that comes in handy later?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It remains to be seen. When she sees that, she doesn&#8217;t put that in the back of her head as something she recalls and realizes that <em>that <\/em>is how you put a zombie down. There&#8217;s a scene that comes later where one of our characters does witness something like that and that&#8217;s part of our apocalyptic education: realizing that body shots are not going to do the job.<\/p>\n<p><strong>We&#8217;ve heard the flu, airborne toxins, something in the water or a virus of some sort as a potential cause. We know the series won&#8217;t ever reveal what caused the outbreak but were there any serious conversations about exploring that? What were some of the things you pitched?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I had some big-swing pitches when Robert and I first sat down and I pitched an origin story with patient zero and he listened and just said, &#8220;Yeah, no. That&#8217;s not what the show is.&#8221; There are certain things we will not have: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/live-feed\/fear-walking-dead-expect-816680\">we will never know<\/a> the cause, the cure and the likelihood of <em>Walking Dead 1 <\/em>and <em>Walking Dead 2 <\/em>stories conflating is slim to none at best. That is something that has been explored in any given number of films in the genre. I can&#8217;t share what my causes were because I may go back to them &mdash; if I&#8217;m still alive in five seasons, I may try to return to it if I can get Robert in a state of mind where he&#8217;s open to such a thing. But there&#8217;s a news article from few years ago that gave me an idea that I thought would have been a nice starting point but I can save that for another show.<\/p>\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s interesting that Travis is teaching his students about survival, courtesy of Jack London. How much of a theme will London be this season &mdash; or with the series as a whole?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Some of the things that Travis articulates in that scene for me, thematically, I like to let those things play out over course of the show. The &#8220;nature always wins&#8221; argument, which is not the most original sentiment or thought, is interesting to try and think about the wolf dog in relation to the man in that story. My question is: Who of our characters is the wolf dog? Who is it that will become one with the new world and one with the apocalypse and one with nature and be able to survive?<\/p>\n<p><strong>At this point, who is the wolf dog?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you watch that scene, Travis finishes with nature always wins and we cut back to the hospital and there&#8217;s a nurse coming in to speak to Nick with a bedpan. Her line is, &#8220;I take my dog out when I want to,&#8221; and Nick says, &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m the dog?&#8221; It&#8217;s a reference from <em>When Harry Met Sally<\/em> and it&#8217;s also connective tissue to the previous scene. Fundamentally, it&#8217;s one of the big questions for the show: Who is best suited to survive in this new world and what are they willing to do? It&#8217;s part of the reason we started with a blended family: What is family? At the end of the original <em>Walking Dead <\/em>pilot, there is a family structure and a group of people who survived who created this surrogate family outside of Atlanta and then Rick finds them. We&#8217;re starting with a highly dysfunctional blended family and there will be a lot of questions as we move forward about who do you save? Is it the people you&#8217;re connected to biologically? Is it the people you bond with as you build this new family and as you deal with the dangers and traumas that are caused by the apocalypse? Where do your alliances and allegiances lie? It&#8217;s all part of the stew.<\/p>\n<p><strong>You&#8217;ve said before that the series is set in L.A. for a reason: to explore reinvention as a theme. How will we see these four central characters evolve amidst this new world?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We end the pilot and Madison and Travis don&#8217;t have the tools to understand what they&#8217;ve just witnessed. Nick is wise in a way that Tobias is: Nick has been validated at the end of the pilot and learned that it wasn&#8217;t the drugs and he&#8217;s not insane. Madness is a theme we&#8217;ll continue to explore as the show progresses. What will be challenging for Nick is waiting for people to catch up with him. He&#8217;s been living on the fringes and in his own apocalypse, and now the real apocalypse has arrived. Initially, it&#8217;s about trying to protect the people they care about most. Alicia is not with them when the pilot ends. She&#8217;s been looking for Matt, who failed to meet her. They&#8217;ll try to wrangle her and bring her back in. From Travis&#8217; perspective, he&#8217;s going to want to find his resentful son, Chris (Lorenzo James Henrie), and his ex-wife, Liza (Elizabeth Rodriguez). They know something terrible is wrong, but they don&#8217;t realize this is the apocalypse or that the dead are rising. For Travis, there has to be an explanation and it becomes a process of hacking away at the expectation that there will be salvation and things will be made well. It&#8217;s going to be very challenging for Travis, specifically. For Madison, going into the second episode and beyond, she needs to protect Alicia and Nick, and that will manifest in different ways because they both have very specific problems that they&#8217;re dealing with.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Wrapping up, what will you be calling the undead this season? The flagship show uses &#8220;walkers&#8221; and won&#8217;t ever say zombie.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Right now, playing off of the idea that they think this is viral and something you can catch that&#8217;s transmitted, they start to call them &#8220;the infected,&#8221; which is a nod to <em>28 Days Later. <\/em>We don&#8217;t get into a place in the story where they&#8217;re going to start throwing names. Whether it&#8217;s biters, roamers or walkers, our characters in season one still think these people are human and sick for a big chunk of time. &#8220;Infected&#8221; made story sense for us, and as things evolve, we&#8217;ll come up with new names.<\/p>\n<p><em>This <a href=\"http:\/\/www.hollywoodreporter.com\/live-feed\/fear-walking-dead-premiere-spoilers-817004\">article<\/a> originally
